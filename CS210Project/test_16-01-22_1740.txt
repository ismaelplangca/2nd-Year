The air is crisp and clear.
In such weather my fading powers still flourish.
To the Broadway-IRT subway.
Have your tokens ready, please.
You and I.
To whom do I refer?
I’m heading downtown alone, after all.
You and I.
Let us go then, you and I.
Down the hall.
Push the button.
Into the elevator.
There is a stink of garlic in it.
I love them.
It is 10:43 AM, Eastern Daylight Savings Time.
The current temperature reading in Central Park is 57°.
The humidity stands at 28% and the barometer is 30.
The chance of precipitation is zero today and 10% tomorrow.
Air quality level is rated good.
David Selig is 41 and counting.
He blinks a lot.
How did this happen to him?
He is of the 1935 vintage.
The Hon Fiorello H LaGuardia, Mayor.
Though perhaps it’s younger—just immediately prewar, say.
Do you remember 1940, Duvid?
This is the trylon, that’s the perisphere.
Anyway the buildings are getting old.
The elevator halts grindingly at the 7th floor.
They stand with their backs toward me.
Buenos dias, señora.
Nice day, isn’t it, ma’am?
What a lovely little child.
But I remain mute.
What’s her name?
Maybe it’s Mrs Altagracia Morales.
Mrs Amantina Figueroa.
Mrs Filomena Mercado.
I love their names.
Ma’am, can you possibly be Mrs Inocencia Fernandez?
Mrs Clodomira Espinosa?
Mrs Bonifacia Colon?
Perhaps Mrs Esperanza Dominguez.
I love you, Esperanza.
Esperanza springs eternal in the human breast.
I was there last Christmas for the bullfights.
Esperanza Springs, New Mexico; I stayed at the Holiday Inn.
No, I’m kidding.
Nimbly I step forward to hold the door open.
To the subway now, hippity-hop, one long block away.
This far uptown the tracks are still elevated.
The results of clean living, I guess.
The station, at this hour, is practically deserted.
The power is deceptively strong in me today.
I’m picking up plenty.
This is the strongest it’s been in weeks.
Surely the low humidity is a factor.
And in time my hairline resumed its retreat.
So too in this instance.
My time is limited.
My situation is truly delicate.
Is she interested in me?
He’ll be turned off by pushiness.
At first there is no signal.
My damnable waning powers betraying me again!
She will see him tonight.
There is nothing in her mind about me.
Selig, your egocentricity kills you every time.
I return my attention to my book.
I climb toward the sunlight.
Under the bright lights in University Hall.
They let me into their college, anyway.
I walk along 116th Street.
My freshman year I played softball there.
I was good at softball.
The Brooklyn Dodgers, remember?
Which happened in 1954.
Christ, so very long ago.
The mermaids singing, each to each.
I do not think that they will sing to me.
This is my office in fair weather or foul.
Today, though, business gets off to a slow start.
That was about 1969, I guess.
Back in the Neolithic.
Big brawny jock looming above me.
Colossal shoulders, chubby innocent face.
He’s deeply embarrassed.
I tell him the terms and he hastily agrees.
He’s smarter than he appears.
Most of them are.
I know my capacity.
So all is well.
Judith will be pleased not to hear from me.
Home, now, to begin my ghostly tasks.
I charge $3.
A minimum grade of B+ guaranteed or there’s no fee.
I’ve never had to make a refund.
Now it was David’s turn.
His parents gave their consent, of course.
They were deeply concerned about his behavior.
He mimed classmates and even teachers with vicious accuracy.
I don’t want to talk to Hitler!
Dr Hitler wants to see me.
Dr Hitler wants to get to know me.
He went anyway.
Dr Hittner chuckled.
You’ve got the wrong man, he said.
I’m Hittner with an n.
Perhaps he had heard such jokes before.
Watery blue eyes twinkled behind rimless glasses.
Even his mother and father sometimes thought things like that.
It was something he had come to expect and accept.
Let’s play some games, shall we?
Dr Hittner said.
His thick fingers expertly reassembled the globe.
Can you put it back together too?
David did it and the rest was easy.
What’s he proving?
When the globe was intact David handed it back.
Would you like to keep it?
Dr Hittner asked.
I don’t need it, David said.
But he pocketed it anyway.
They played a few more games.
Do any of these shapes remind you of real things?
the doctor asked.
Next they played word games.
Were those the right words to say?
Who was the winner in this game?
Why did Dr Hittner seem so upset?
Finally they stopped playing games and simply talked.
You’re a very bright little boy, Dr Hittner said.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
But how will you earn a living?
I’ll get money from people when I need it.
Are you happy here in school?
The teachers are too strict.
The work is too dumb.
The children don’t like me.
Do you ever wonder why they don’t like you?
Because I’m smarter than they are, David said.
Because I— Ooops.
Almost said it.
Because I can see what they’re thinking.
Mustn’t ever tell anyone that.
Dr Hittner was waiting for him to finish the sentence.
Because I make a lot of trouble in class.
And why do you do that, David?
I don’t know.
It gives me something to do, I guess.
Don’t you want people to like you?
I don’t care.
I don’t need it.
Everybody needs friends, David.
I’ve got friends.
Why do you hit your friends?
Because I don’t like them.
Because they’re dumb.
Shrugging, David said, I can get along without them.
I have fun just being by myself.
Are you happy at home?
I guess so.
You love your mommy and daddy?
This is an important question.
Give the right answer, David.
Give him the answer he wants.
Yes, David said.
No hesitation now.
You like being all alone?
The afternoons are the best time.
When I’m home from school and there’s nobody around.
Am I going to have a baby brother or sister?
Chuckles from the doctor.
I’m sure I don’t know.
the doctor asked quietly, not smiling now at all.
I don’t know.
It was just an idea.
Which I found inside your head, doctor.
And now I want to get out of here.
I don’t want to talk to you any more.
Hey, your name isn’t really Hittner, is it?
With an n?
I bet I know your real name.
I never could send my thoughts into anybody else’s head.
I could only receive.
Do you read me?
I love you, Annie.
Over and out.
My way of knowing such things varies.
Call it body language on the telepathic wavelength.
There’s ecstasy in that.
There’s an electrifying sense of contact.
Incidentally, the soul speaks a universal language.
When I look into the mind of Mrs.
It’s all going from me now.
The Castle is unfinished, but its conclusion seems plain.
Both books get off to rapid starts.
Structurally the novel is over right here.
His quest is ended.
The action concludes with that perception.
The Castle, also, is too ponderous.
Like a Mahler symphony, it collapses of its own weight.
K is a pathetic figure, Joseph K a tragic one.
That’s not so bad.
Six double-spaced typed pages.
Dupee in May, 1955.
All right, now.
Thank God for the cerebral reducing valve!
Mutants, all of us.
The psychedelic drugs, he thought, have this effect.
Fasting and physical mortification could get you there also.
Remorse, self-loathing, and the fear of hell.
Fasting and prayer.
Whips and chains.
Acid, mescaline, psilocybin?
I don’t think I’d care to go there again.
Mortification of the flesh?
What does that leave?
Fasting and prayer?
I could fast, I suppose.
I’d feel like a fool.
Dear God, give me my power again.
Dear Moses, please help me.
Crap on that.
What’s left, then?
Remorse, self-loathing, and the fear of hell?
Invent something new.
Flagellation of the mind, perhaps?
I’ll try that.
Flagellation of the aching, weakening, throbbing, dissolving mind.
The treacherous, hateful mind.
Why not let it fade?
It’s always been a curse to him, hasn’t it?
Leave well enough alone, Duvid.
Let it fade.
Let it fade.
On the other hand, without the power, what are you?
You dread losing it despite all it’s done to you.
Fight on, then.
Read Huxley again.
Try acid, if you dare.
Try fasting, at least.
All right, fasting.
I’ll skip the chow mein.
I’ll skip the eggroll.
Hark to the silvery jangle of the telephone.
The hour is late.
Dr Hittner, with some important questions about making pee-pee?
I stare at the telephone, clueless.
Am I interrupting something?
Typical Judith opening.
A quiet night at home.
I’m ghosting a term paper on The Odyssey.
Got any bright ideas for me, Jude?
You haven’t called in two weeks.
I was broke.
Shit, she says, I wasn’t angry at you.
You sounded mad as hell.
I didn’t mean any of that stuff.
Why did you think I was serious?
Just because I was yelling?
A shiftless sponger, I think.
A shiftless sponger.
I lost control.
You of all people shouldn’t have thought I was serious.
You were saying it with your head too, Jude.
Her voice is suddenly small and contrite.
Are you sure?
It came through loud and clear.
Oh, Jesus, Duv, have a heart!
You’re all I’ve got, Duv, you and the baby.
Not much comes through these days.
Anyway, look, it isn’t worth hassling over.
Are you okay now for money, though?
I told you, I’m ghosting term papers.
I’m getting by.
I think I’d better work instead.
I’ve got a lot of papers to write, Jude.
It’s the busy season.
It would be just the two of us.
Just you and me.
We could talk.
We’ve got so much to talk about.
Why don’t you come over, Duv?
You don’t need to work all day and all night.
I’ll cook up something you like.
I’ll do the spaghetti and hot sauce.
You name it.
Come over and I’ll be a mama for you, Duv.
Come let me be loving, brother.
Maybe the night after next.
I’ll call you.
No chance for tomorrow?
I don’t think so, I say.
There is silence.
She doesn’t want to beg me.
Seeing anyone interesting?
Not seeing anyone at all.
A flinty edge to her voice.
She is 31 years old.
I’m between men right now.
Maybe I’m off men altogether.
I throttle a somber laugh.
What happened to that travel agent you were seeing?
That was just a gimmick.
Otherwise I couldn’t have afforded to go.
I was using him.
I felt shitty about it.
Last month I broke off.
I wasn’t in love with him.
I don’t think I even liked him.
It didn’t cost him anything, Duv.
What are you saying, anyway?
That I’m a whore?
Okay, I’m a whore.
At least I’m trying to go straight for a while.
Lots of fresh orange juice and plenty of serious reading.
I’m reading Proust now, would you believe that?
I’ve still got some work to do tonight, Jude.
I didn’t mean to intrude.
Will you come for dinner this week?
I’ll think about it.
I’ll let you know.
Why do you hate me so much, Duv?
I don’t hate you.
Don’t forget to call, she says.
Clutching at straws.
I should tell you about Toni now.
I’ll tell you about Kitty some other time.
Can I reconstruct Toni?
Let’s try it in a few swift strokes.
She was 24 that year.
A tall coltish girl, five feet six, five feet seven.
Agile and awkward, both at once.
Long legs, long arms, thin wrists, thin ankles.
Glossy black hair, very straight, cascading to her shoulders.
Warm, quick brown eyes, alert and quizzical.
Full, heavy breasts.
So often so tired.
My mother was built 32-A, no cozy pillows there.
Ah, now, Selig, show some filial piety, for God’s sake!
The third time was a sheer disastrous accident.
Only the first was a deliberate probe.
A lesson I learned very young.
I was afraid it might frighten her away.
Her beauty stung me.
I hadn’t been with a woman in months.
Next I poked into her mind.
I sank in, deep, finding myself in warm, rich loam.
Quickly got oriented.
No, she wasn’t sleeping with the writer.
Physically he registered absolute zero for her.
She didn’t even like his writing, I learned.
Here’s the Truman stuff, I said to my employer.
There’s more coming in from the Truman Library in Missouri.
A quick guarded look at her.
Wait, she said.
We can ride down together.
I’m just about done here.
The man of letters shot me a poisonous envious glance.
Oh, God, fired again.
But he bade us both civil goodbyes.
In the elevator going down we stood apart.
In the street we stood apart also, dithering a moment.
could I drop her off anywhere?
She said she lived on 105th and West End.
Three rooms, indifferently furnished: mostly books, records, scatter-rugs, posters.
She had no place to stay.
Shy grins, hers, mine.
So she moved in.
She had needed a port in a storm.
I had happened to offer one.
So be it.
There was time for things to ripen.
We slept very little, our first two weeks.
Not quite everything poured out.
Then, our third week.
My second peep into her mind.
Her long lean form rearing far above me.
Her face half hidden in her own dangling unruly hair.
Her eyes closed.
Her lips slack.
Cleopatra by moonlight.
I found no thought of me in her mind.
Only sheer animal frenzy, bursting from every nerve.
So it was then with Toni.
I lost contact with her then.
The upheavals of orgasm shatter the fragile telepathic link.
But never to be repeated, either.
To take no unfair advantage of her.
To stay out of her head forever after.
By damnable abominable accident.
Oy, that third time!
We’re going to get a little sister for you.
It was no surprise, of course.
And, naturally, he had been reading their minds.
It was like an endless radio broadcast without commercials.
They had no secrets from him.
He had no shame about spying.
They never suspected he was doing it.
But they had no inkling.
Sibling: a brother or a sister.
Oh, the treacherous horse-faced bastard!
But what else could he have expected?
The only child is an emotionally deprived child.
Hittner’s universal panacea: lots of siblings.
As though there are no neurotics in big families.
But at last the seed takes root.
But he knew.
The insecurities, the irrational hostilities.
How can I love this child that isn’t mine?
All this the all-perceiving David perceives.
The old man yields by Christmas.
It’s got to be Jewish.
He wasn’t fooled.
How could anyone fool this omniscient child?
For many weeks that appeared to be the case.
She had found a lovely little girl, four months old.
David hated her instantly.
It was incredible how much noise she could emit.
But he loathed having Judith around.
So they have a slit instead of a thing.
Okay, but so what?
In general she was an irritating distraction.
She didn’t appear to have any thoughts.
He sought to sink his hooks into her soul.
I have your whole mind!
He stared more intensely, redoubling the vigor of his concentration.
Her smile wavered and vanished.
Her brows puckered into a frown.
For a moment he thought he might actually succeed.
An instant later she was gurgling again.
She had defeated him.
And she hated back.
Oh, was she ever an expert at hating.
My first and my last, eight years ago.
Actually it wasn’t my trip at all, but Toni’s.
What I did was hitchhike on Toni’s trip.
Let me tell you.
This happened in the summer of ’68.
That summer was a bad trip all in itself.
Do you remember ’68 at all?
I mean American society.
It was the year of sideburns and Buffalo Bill mustachios.
Gene McCarthy, a Senator from—where?
And wasn’t that convention a lovely festival of American patriotism?
I forget that year’s movies.
Maybe it was the year of Rosemary’s Baby.
Let’s see, what else?
His team lost the World Series, though.
What am I saying?
The Tigers won, 4 games to 3.
But Mickey Lolich was the star, not McLain.
That was the sort of year it was.
Oh, Christ, I’ve forgotten one significant chunk of history.
and classes being suspended Shut It Down!
Besides, it was cheap—$14.
Are you still following me?
I loved her and I think she loved me.
I haven’t had much love in my life.
Unable to give, he cannot get.
The loop closes upon itself and he is trapped within.
What defines love, anyway?
We excited one another in every imaginable way.
We never bored each other.
I’d call these things the parameters of love.
I studied them a moment or two, without comprehending.
Acid, she said finally.
Teddy gave them to me.
Teddy was her boss, the editor-in-chief.
I had read Huxley on mescaline in 1957.
I was fascinated and tempted.
Though still I was curious about it.
It’s supposed to be dynamite stuff, she said.
Absolutely pure, laboratory quality.
Both of us?
She gave me a peculiar look.
Do you think acid drives you out of your mind?
I don’t know.
I’ve heard a lot of scary stories.
You’ve never tripped?
No, I said.
But I’ve watched friends of mine while they were tripping.
They don’t go out of their minds, David.
Can you imagine Huxley out of his mind?
Gibbering and drooling and smashing furniture?
And the girl who jumped out of a window?
They were unstable, she said loftily.
But that doesn’t mean you would, or me.
Those are one-in-a-million cases.
She sounded impatient with me.
There was a patronizing, lecturing tone in her voice.
What’s the matter, David?
Are you afraid to trip?
But it’s a risky thing.
We just don’t know.
I suppose so.
There’s no hurry.
You trip tomorrow and I’ll watch.
I’ll trip on Sunday and you’ll watch.
All right, Toni?
It wasn’t all right.
All right, she said softly.
It isn’t worth a hassle.
We pretended it wasn’t there.
There wasn’t much conversation.
From time to time she grinned nervously.
First Eloise, the sleek black hooker.
Then Miss Theotokis, the grim-faced nurse who worked at St.
The fine old New York tradition.
How long will it take to hit?
About an hour and a half, she said.
In fact it was more like fifty minutes.
A slight touch of nausea.
There’s a prickling at the back of my neck.
Can I get you anything?
Glass of water?
Really I am.
A smile, timid but genuine.
She seemed a little apprehensive but not at all frightened.
Eager for the voyage.
Visual effects were beginning.
The color of everything was unnaturally bright.
She looked flushed, excited, happy.
I had feared the worst.
But she was making out all right.
Lost in transcendental realms of mystery was my Toni.
I admire capable women.
But what is this, now?
What’s happening to my head?
Why this sudden feeling of suffocation?
The pounding in my chest?
The dryness in my throat?
Why do I feel them now?
Muscles leap about of their own accord in my thighs.
Is this what they call a contact high?
Obviously you’re picking these phenomena right out of her mind!
Is it so obvious?
I consider the possibility.
Am I reading Toni without knowing it?
Apparently I am.
What other explanation can there be?
Shall I get out of her mind?
The acid effects distract me.
I look at Toni and she seems transformed.
Her lips are too full, her mouth too wide.
All those teeth.
Row upon row upon row, like a shark.
Why have I never noticed that predatory mouth before?
She frightens me.
To escape her I glance toward the window.
The building across the street is unnaturally squat today.
There is menace in its altered form.
The ceiling is coming toward me, too.
Is this what tripping is like?
I should turn this off, before it freaks me altogether.
I want out.
Well, easily done.
Only they don’t work this time.
I am helpless before the power of the acid.
I am wide open to everything emanating from Toni.
I am caught up in it.
I go deeper and deeper.
This is a trip.
This is a bad trip.
This is a very bad trip.
How odd: Toni was having a good trip, wasn’t she?
So it seemed to one outside observer.
Whatever is in Toni’s mind floods into mine.
Can such darkness really live within her?
Her past is on parade.
Gaudy images, bathed in a lurid light.
They advance mechanically, a thundering legion.
Their rigid cocks blaze with a terrible red light.
Their faces are masks.
I know none of them.
Why am I not on line too?
Where am I?
Where am I?
Ah, there: off to one side, insignificant, irrelevant.
Is that thing me?
Is that how she really sees me?
A hairy vampire bat, a crouching huddled bloodsucker?
How can I break this link?
I stumble to my feet.
Staggering, splay-footed, nauseated.
The room whirls.
Where is the door?
The doorknob retreats from me.
I lunge for it.
Her voice reverberates unendingly.
Some fresh air, I mutter.
It does no good.
The nightmare images pursue me through the door.
The Chinaman drifts by me as though a ghost.
Far away I hear the telephone ringing.
The green wall sweats green blood.
A voice like thistles says, Selig?
Is something wrong?
It’s Donaldson, the junkie.
His face is a skull’s face.
His hand on my shoulder is all bones.
Are you sick?
I shake my head.
He says, You’re tripping, man!
Isn’t that right?
I go lurching into my room.
Toni is sitting where I left her.
She looks baffled.
Every sound she makes is torment for me.
Toni, I thought you loved me.
Toni, I thought I made you happy.
I don’t understand, she whispers.
You’re crying, David.
Your face is all blotchy.
Did I say something wrong?
Please don’t carry on, David.
Spreading its rubbery wings.
Baring its yellow fangs.
My face pushed against the carpet.
The smell of dust in my dry nostrils.
Trilobites crawling through my brain.
A bat crawling through hers.
Shrill laughter in the hallway.
The refrigerator door: slam, slam, slam!
The cannibals dancing upstairs.
The ceiling pressing against my back.
My hungry mind looting Toni’s soul.
Toni says, You took the other acid?
Then how can you be tripping?
I make no reply.
I crouch, I huddle, I sweat, I moan.
This is the descent into hell.
Huxley warned me.
I didn’t want Toni’s trip.
I didn’t ask to see any of this.
My defenses are destroyed now.
She overwhelms me.
She engulfs me.
Toni says, Are you reading my mind, David?
The miserable ultimate confession.
I’m reading your mind.
What did you say?
I said I’m reading your mind.
I can see every thought.
I see myself the way you see me.
Oh, Christ, Toni, Toni, Toni, it’s so awful!
Finally I rise.
Her face is horribly pale; her eyes are rigid.
She asks for clarifications.
What’s this about reading minds?
I really said it, I tell her.
I never asked any such thing, she says.
I heard you ask it.
But I didn’t— Trembling, now.
Both of us.
Her voice is bleak.
You’re trying to bum-trip me, aren’t you, David?
I don’t understand.
Why would you want to hurt me?
Why are you messing me up?
It was a good trip.
It was a good trip.
Not for me, I say.
You weren’t tripping.
But I was.
She thinks I’ve deliberately tried to injure her.
Nothing I can say now will repair things.
Nothing can ever repair things.
She despises me.
Nor I her.
Bad trip, I mutter.
I stayed with them the rest of the afternoon.
The flamboyant phantoms ceased to vex my soul.
Color and dimension and texture returned to their proper states.
Time trickled away.
Nixon, pot, and a great many other things.
Eventually I felt better.
Toni was not there.
The place seemed oddly altered.
She had moved out.
October is dying too quickly.
There are puddles everywhere.
Here I sit.
The Novels of Kafka.
Shaw as Tragedian.
The Concept of Synthetic A Priori Statements.
Odysseus as a Symbol of Society.
Aeschylus and the Aristotelian Tragedy.
Five minutes to eleven.
My clients will be arriving soon.
Meanwhile I scan the passing parade.
Students hurrying by, clutching mounds of books.
Hair rippling in the wind, breasts bobbling.
Especially the bearded ones.
Even the professors look young to me these days.
Isn’t that a killer?
In 1950 today’s newly fledged Ph.
How can those infants have doctorates so soon?
Playing my old game, my only game.
But no: my head is full of cotton today.
Only muffled murmurs come to me, indistinct, content-free.
This is one of the bad days.
It is the triumph of entropy.
I am reminded of Forster’s Mrs.
The sum and essence of mankind’s earnest strivings: Boum.
Perhaps it is all I deserve.
I must work to correct this.
It is not too late to wage war against entropy.
Come back to life.
Get it up, you miserable spy!
Give me my fix!
Within me the power stirs.
Neurotic but not altogether psycho yet.
Tickets for the opera, but I have to.
Fucking is fun, fucking is very important, but there’s more.
It and me, me and it.
I used to discuss such things with Nyquist.
Has he entered these exhalations yet?
Who carried a somewhat similar intruder within his skull.
Nyquist didn’t like my outlook.
That’s schizoid, man, setting up a duality like that.
Your power is you.
You are your power.
Why try to alienate yourself from your own brain?
Probably Nyquist was right, but it’s much too late.
Here is my client, the bulky halfback, Paul F Bruno.
Six pages, I say.
He has given me a ten-dollar advance.
You owe me another eleven bucks.
Do you want to read it first?
How good is it?
You won’t be sorry.
I’ll take your word for it.
He manages a painful, close-mouthed grin.
Oh, well: the gratitude of the goy.
I pocket his money.
I watch his broad retreating back.
A basketball player, obviously.
His legs alone seem five feet long.
He and Bruno talk for a moment.
Bruno points toward me.
The black nods.
I am about to gain a new client, I realize.
He sways bouncily on the balls of his feet.
Your name Selig?
Yahya Lumumba, he says.
His eyes, glossy white against glossy purple, blaze with fury.
Well, what would I know of college basketball stars?
He says, I hear you do term papers, man.
You got a good recommend from my pal Bruno there.
How much you charge?
He considers it.
It’s how I earn my living, Mr.
I hate myself for that toadying, cowardly mister.
That’s about $20 for an average-length paper.
A decent job takes a fair amount of time, right?
An elaborate shrug.
Okay, I’m not hassling you, man.
I got need for your work.
You know anything about Europydes?
That’s what I said.
That Greek cat who wrote plays.
I know who you mean.
What sort of paper do you need, Mr.
Five to ten pages.
It due by November 10.
Can you swing it?
I think so, I say, reaching for my pen.
I’ll need some information about you for the heading.
I must know these things.
Hello, big black man.
I have not yet reached the level of this-minute thought.
I push deeper.
This man Lumumba is constantly boiling within, I realize.
A roaring furnace.
The heat is overwhelming.
I can’t handle this volcanic blast.
He is a pillar of hatred.
And my poor enfeebled power can’t take it.
All is indistinct.
All is muffled.
We are back to that again.
A new stage on my downward path.
I look up, dazed, shattered.
I say faintly, I’d like ten dollars now in advance.
The rest you pay when I deliver the paper.
Take it or leave it, man.
Can you manage five?
As a binder.
Faith isn’t enough.
I have expenses.
Europydes, Sophocles, Eeskilus.
I sit stunned, shivering, listening to the bellowing silence.
The mark of Cain, perhaps.
The power was a divine gift.
The power brought ecstasy.
Is that a curse?
Is that so terrible?
This you would spurn?
Because the power brought ecstasy.
The power brought ecstasy.
That’s the whole megillah in a single crisp phrase.
Not him, not the accursed David Selig.
Fourteen to twenty-five, though.
The golden years.
It was so very much more vivid then.
Life was like a waking dream.
The intense flavor of existence.
Steeped in the rich juices of perception.
The change had been absolute, qualitative rather than quantitative.
The sun dangles in a cloudless sky.
A gentle wind stirs the willows bordering the cornfield.
The young corn trembles.
The brook burbles.
A starling circles overhead.
He hears crickets.
City boy, digging the country.
Paul Selig is forever attempting unwise business ventures.
Willy-nilly, David and Barbara are thrown together for the day.
This is naive of them.
She carries a paperback poetry anthology.
David is not deceived by it.
So he is left to his own resources.
He has ways of entertaining himself.
Time for mind-movies.
Lazily he casts his net.
The power rises and goes forth, looking for emanations.
What shall I read, what shall I read?
A sense of contact.
But he does get into the bee’s head.
He burrows deep into a steamy, pollen-laden blossom.
He goes aloft again.
He sees the world through the bee’s faceted eyes.
But the mind of a bee is a limited one.
David bores easily.
She is laying an egg!
The smarmy hen-coop odor, sharp and biting.
A sense of too much straw all about.
The world looks dark and dull to this bird.
The egg slides through the hatch and lands safely.
The hen subsides, fulfilled, exhausted.
David departs from her in this moment of rapture.
Her legs are spread and her eyes are closed.
Her skin is damp with sweat.
He picks up her clamorous heartbeat.
And now he senses the first dizzying spasms of orgasm.
finds a new sanctuary.
All is calm here.
He glides through a dark cold environment.
David has never entered the elder Schiele’s mind before.
Astonishment: old Schiele is a mystic, an ecstatic!
No dourness here.
No dark Lutheran vindictiveness.
God floods his soul.
He touches the unity of all things.
How can this be?
Feel his joy!
Sensations drench him!
David shares his pleasure.
He kneels in his mind, reverent, awed.
The world is a mighty hymn.
Is this how Schiele goes through his days?
Is such happiness possible?
David is surprised to find tears bulging in his eyes.
This simple man, this narrow man, lives in daily grace.
She lies back, sweat-sticky, exhausted.
Idly she touches her softening nipples.
David shifts to Hans and finds him no better.
Hans will be seeing her on Saturday night.
Father and son, old and young, priest and profaner.
David sustains the twin contact a moment.
But powers decay.
Time leaches the colors from the best of visions.
The world becomes grayer.
Entropy beats us down.
Judith’s dark, rambling apartment fills with pungent smells.
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
Fix yourself a drink, she calls to me.
She does everything at top speed.
Is the kid making a lot of trouble for you?
My nephew, she means.
Four years old.
All for Judith and her cub.
The rent is cosmic, but Judith can manage it.
Bach harpsichord sonatas tinkle from the thousand-dollar speaker system.
A pile of broken-backed paperbacks clutters one wall.
A good life my sister leads here.
Good and miserable.
The kid eyes me untrustingly.
An understandable error.
So I’m an enemy.
He’d gut me if he could.
She says, I’m glad you decided to come.
So am I.
You look awfully peaked though.
Just hungry, Jude.
I’ll fix that in five minutes.
Sounds of water running.
She says something else; the sink drowns her out.
I look idly around the bedroom.
On the night-table sit two fat textbooky-looking books.
Analytical Neuroendocrinology and Studies in the Physiology of Thermoregulation.
Unlikely reading for Judith.
Maybe she’s been hired to translate them into French.
Both by the same author: K.
You going to medical school these days?
The books, you mean?
A new name.
Dr Karl F.
About fifty, I’d guess.
Judith digs older men.
While I raid her consciousness she tells me about him.
Her current friend, the kid’s latest uncle.
Including her body, I assume.
Newly divorced after a 25-year marriage.
Uh-huh: she likes getting them on the rebound.
A pleasant perfume.
Hello, she says.
It’s my fault.
I was too early.
Anyway, you weren’t a mess at all.
She leads me to the livingroom.
She carries herself well.
The slim sultry type.
You and me, sis, you and me.
Chips off the old block.
She produces a wintry smile.
Cheers, we say.
Why don’t you move back downtown?
We could see more of each other.
It’s cheap up there.
Do we want to see more of each other?
Who else do we have?
You have Karl.
I don’t have him or anybody.
Just my kid and my brother.
She doesn’t know about that.
Are we really friends, Jude?
Now we are.
People change, Duv.
They grow up.
That’s over now.
You don’t want me poking around in there.
Go ahead, she says.
I’d rather not.
I deal myself another two ounces of rum.
The hand shakes a little.
Shouldn’t you check the spaghetti sauce?
Maybe it’s boiling over.
Let it boil.
I haven’t finished my drink.
Duv, are you still having trouble?
With your power, I mean.
Worse than ever.
What do you think is happening?
Insouciant old me.
I’m losing it, that’s all.
It’s like hair, I suppose.
It never did me any good anyway.
You don’t mean that.
Show me any good it did me, Jude.
It made you someone special.
It made you unique.
A gift from God.
A useless gift.
Except if I’d gone into the sideshow business.
It made you a richer person.
More complex, more interesting.
Without it you might have been someone quite ordinary.
With it I turned out to be someone quite ordinary.
A nobody, a zero.
You pity yourself a lot, Duv.
I’ve got a lot to pity myself for.
More Pernod, Jude?
I ought to look after dinner.
Will you pour the wine?
She goes into the kitchen.
Judith returns, toting a well-laden tray: spaghetti, garlic bread, cheese.
We clink wine-glasses.
We eat in silence a few minutes.
I praise the spaghetti.
Be my guest.
You say you’re glad the power’s going.
Is that snow-job directed at me or at yourself?
Because you’re snowing somebody.
You hate the idea of losing it, don’t you?
A lot, Duv.
All right, a lot.
I’m of two minds.
I’d like it to vanish completely.
Christ, I wish I’d never had it.
Where’s my identity?
I’m Selig the Mindreader, right?
The Amazing Mental Man.
So if I stop being him—you see, Jude?
The pain’s all over your face.
I’m so sorry, Duv.
That you’re losing it.
That was a long time ago.
I know what you must be going through, now.
Do you have any idea why you’re losing it?
A function of aging, I guess.
I doubt it, Jude.
I don’t know how it works.
You’ve never let yourself be studied, have you?
I don’t want to be a case history.
I’ve always kept a low profile.
I’d probably be lynched.
In my whole life, how many?
Three, I say.
And I wouldn’t willingly have told any of them.
Then there’s Tom Nyquist, who I don’t see any more.
What about the tall brunette?
I never explicitly told her.
I tried to hide it from her.
She found out indirectly.
A lot of people may have found out indirectly.
But I’ve only told three.
I don’t want to be known as a freak.
So let it fade.
Let it die.
You want to keep it, though.
To keep it and lose it both.
That’s a contradiction.
Do I contradict myself?
Very well, then I contradict myself.
I am large, I contain multitudes.
What can I say, Jude?
What can I tell you that’s true?
Are you in pain?
Who isn’t in pain?
You said there was ecstasy in it for you, once.
That flood of information, that vicarious experience.
Your mind can’t get it up.
Do you see it that way, as a sexual metaphor?
I give her more wine.
I almost feel warmth toward her.
Keep away, man, keep away.
She didn’t want me to meet her fiancé.
Afraid I’d tell him about her other men, I guess.
So long ago.
Maybe we love each other a little now, Jude.
I don’t come any more, she says abruptly.
You know, I used to come, practically every time.
The original Hot Pants Kid, me.
A short circuit down below.
I started coming every fifth time, every tenth time.
Feeling the ability to respond slip away from me.
Finally I couldn’t come at all.
I still can’t.
Not in three years.
So I know what it’s like, Duv.
What you must be going through.
To lose your best way of making contact with others.
To lose contact gradually with yourself.
To become a stranger in your own head.
Did you know that about me?
About the troubles I’ve been having in bed?
I hesitate briefly.
The icy glare in her eyes gives her away.
The resentment she feels.
How fragile our relationship is!
What the hell, though.
Yes, I tell her.
I knew about it.
I thought so.
You’ve never stopped probing me.
Her smile is all hateful glee now.
She’s glad I’m losing it.
I’m always wide open to you, Duv.
Don’t worry, you won’t be much longer.
Oh, you sadistic bitch!
Oh, you beautiful ball-buster!
And you’re all I’ve got.
How about some more spaghetti, Jude?
They withdraw, and lamenting Electra comes to the tomb.
Orestes then reappears, and identifies himself to Electra.
He takes refuge in the temple of Apollo.
Euripides is concerned with dramatic credibility, whereas Aeschylus is not.
Shit shit shit.
This is deadly.
This is no fucking good at all.
Could Yahya Lumumba have written any of this crap?
Phony from Word One.
Why should Yahya Lumumba give a shit about Greek tragedy?
Why should I?
I’ll tear this up and start again.
I’ll write it jivey, man.
I’ll give it dat ole watermelon rhythm.
God help me to think black.
But I can’t.
But I can’t.
But I can’t.
Christ, I’d like to throw up.
I think I’m getting a fever.
Maybe a joint would help some.
Let’s get high and try again.
A lil ole stick of mootah.
Get some soul into it, man.
Smartass white Jew-bastard, get some soul into it, you hear?
we have a high ole time.
Yeah, that’s it, man!
You’re digging it!
What a dumb schmuck you are, Selig.
What a dumb schmuck.
But you can’t will love.
Besides, my intentions had never been that good.
I saw her as a rival from the word go.
I was supposed to be the center of everything.
Just a thing, an item of furniture.
But I knew better than to believe that.
I was ten years old, remember, when they adopted her.
Your ten-year-old, he’s no fool.
I couldn’t help resenting that.
I offer no defense at this late date.
The cycle of hatred began with me.
With me, Jude, with me, with me, with me.
You didn’t want to.
At three in the afternoon?
Sleep well, sister, sleep on and on.
My mother, mild and dim; my father, weary and bitter.
All my life they had steadily grown smaller.
They seemed very small now.
They seemed close to the vanishing point.
I had never lived in this apartment.
From him came a dull sludgy emanation of fatigue.
HURLS MAN 115 MILES INTO SPACE, cried the banner headline.
I groped for some way to connect with my father.
What did you think of the space voyage?
Did you listen to the broadcast?
Who gives a damn?
It’s all crazy.
A waste of everybody’s time and money.
ELIZABETH VISITS POPE IN VATICAN.
Fat Pope John, looking like a well-fed rabbi.
JOHNSON TO MEET LEADERS IN ASIA ON US TROOP USE.
He skimmed onward, skipping pages.
HELP OF GOLDBERG ASKED ON ROCKETS.
KENNEDY SIGNS WAGE-FLOOR BILL.
He lingered at the sports pages.
A faint flicker of interest.
Who do you like in the Derby?
He shook his head.
What do I know about horses?
He had stopped responding.
The world had defeated him.
What was I doing with myself?
Had I seen any good movies?
L’Avventura, I said.
Is that a French film?
Italian, I said.
She wanted me to describe the plot.
She listened patiently, looking troubled, not following anything.
Who did you go with?
Are you seeing any nice girls?
My son the bachelor.
Already 26 and not even engaged.
I won’t give you the grandchildren you’re waiting for.
Her door was ajar.
I glanced in.
All right, make a gesture, be friendly, Duvid.
It won’t cost you anything.
I knocked lightly.
Hi, it’s me, I said.
Okay if I come in?
My sister’s erotic inauguration.
The night before.
The drive home, silent, shamefaced.
Into the house, tiptoe, hoarsely greeting the vigilant, unsleeping parents.
The late-night shower.
Inspection and cleansing of the deflowered and slightly swollen vulva.
Uneasy sleep, frequently punctured.
Judith, your secret is no secret to me.
How are you?
Stagily casual, she drawled, Sleepy.
I was out very late.
How come you’re here?
I drop in to see the family now and then.
Nice to have seen you.
That isn’t friendly, Jude.
Am I that loathsome to you?
Why are you bothering me, Duv?
I told you, I’m trying to be sociable.
You’re my only sister, the only one I’ll ever have.
You’ve done that.
Do you care?
If I didn’t care, would I ask?
Sure, she said.
You don’t give a crap about what I’ve been doing.
You don’t need to ask me polite questions.
It isn’t natural coming from you.
Hey, hold on!
Let’s not be dueling so fast, sister.
I’m just furniture to you.
The drippy little sister.
Have you ever talked to me?
I’m a total stranger to you.
No, you’re not.
What the hell do you know about me?
Quit it, Jude.
One thing about me.
For example, I know that you got laid last night.
We were both amazed by that.
she said finally.
What did you say, Duv?
You heard it.
Say it again.
Leave me alone, Jude.
Who told you?
Who told you?
Nobody, I muttered.
Her smile was terrifyingly triumphant.
You know something?
I believe you.
I honestly believe you.
Nobody told you.
I wish I had never come in here.
Why won’t you admit it?
You see into people’s minds, don’t you, Duvid?
You’re some kind of circus freak.
I’ve suspected that a long time.
Talking about your luck’ at guessing things.
I knew the real scoop.
I said to myself, This fucker is reading my mind.
Only it’s true, isn’t it?
You don’t guess.
Spying on us.
Isn’t that so?
I heard a sound behind me.
I jumped, frightened.
A vague, dreamy grin.
Good morning, Judith.
Or good afternoon, I should say.
Having a nice chat, children?
I’m so glad.
Don’t forget to have breakfast, Judith.
And she drifted on her way.
Judith said sharply, Why didn’t you tell her?
Describe the whole thing.
Stop it, Jude.
You didn’t answer my other question.
You’ve got this weird power, don’t you?
And you’ve been secretly spying on people all your life.
I knew it.
I didn’t know, but I really did, all along.
And it explains so much.
I didn’t feel private.
I hope I never see you again, Duv.
Now that I know what you are.
I wish I never had seen you.
I’ll cut your balls off.
Now clear out of here so I can get dressed.
I stumbled away.
I know that you got laid last night.
Why had I told her that?
There are no accidents, Freud said.
There are never any slips of the tongue.
Everything’s deliberate, on one level or another.
And now Judith knew.
I had given her a weapon.
How strange that she never chose to use it.
Nyquist was too wily, too elusive.
Playing it safe, Selig said nothing.
Snow was falling.
High winds whipped the drifts about.
Parked cars were disappearing under the white blanket.
It had been snowing on and off for three days.
Snow was general all over the Northeast.
Nothing was moving in New York City.
There was no action at the airports.
Basketball games were being canceled at Madison Square Garden.
I like that.
What is it, David?
James Joyce, said Selig sourly.
The Dead,’ from Dubliners.
I asked you yesterday not to do that.
I envy the breadth and depth of your culture.
I like to borrow fancy quotations from you.
Do you always have to play them back at me?
I forgot you didn’t like it.
You never forget a thing, Tom.
You never do anything accidentally.
Snow is general, said Nyquist.
It isn’t ever going to stop.
What are we going to do today?
The same as yesterday and the day before, I imagine.
How about getting laid?
I don’t think you’re my type, Selig said.
Nyquist flashed an empty smile.
We could look, I suppose, Selig said, shrugging.
Is there any more bourbon?
I’ll get it, Nyquist said.
He brought the bottle over.
Selig had never seen him hurry.
He still had the elusive traces of an accent.
Nyquist lived in the same building, four floors higher.
Not only that, having it hadn’t crippled him at all.
He held no job and apparently never had.
That was how they had happened to meet.
—Tell me where you are.
—35 Pierrepont Street.
—No, I know that.
I mean, where are you in the building?
—I’m on the eighth.
What’s your name?
The mental contact was stunningly intimate.
But he did not draw back.
It was, he knew, only an illusion.
He was sending nothing, nor was Nyquist.
At last he gently withdrew, as did Nyquist.
I’ll meet you by the elevator.
He was remote without actually being cold.
Possibly it was because he had discovered fellow freaks before.
There are others, he said.
You’re the fifth.
Two women, three men.
Are you still in touch with the others?
We drifted apart, Nyquist said.
What did you expect?
That we’d be clannish?
I think two of them are dead now.
I don’t think of myself as one of a tribe.
I never met another one, said Selig.
It isn’t important.
What’s important is living your own life.
I don’t know.
Five, six years old, maybe.
I thought everybody could do it.
What kind of work do you do?
As little as I can, said Nyquist.
He grinned and thrust his perceptors brusquely into Selig’s mind.
How limpid Nyquist’s soul was!
How unmarred by life!
Where did he keep his anguish?
Where did he hide his loneliness, his fear, his insecurity?
It’s all over your head.
What’s the problem, Selig?
You can get right inside people’s heads.
You can do something that 99.
of the human race can’t do.
How can you pretend you’re isolated?
The information I get is useless, Selig said.
I can’t act on it.
I might just as well not be reading it in.
Because it’s just voyeurism.
I’m spying on them.
You feel guilty about that?
I didn’t ask for my gift, Nyquist said.
I just happen to have it.
Since I have it, I use it.
I like it.
I like the life I lead.
I like myself.
Why don’t you like yourself, Selig?
You tell me.
He’ll humiliate me, Selig thought.
He’ll devour me.
But that panic faded.
The superhuman condition, Nyquist called it.
They became close friends.
Hold out your glass, Nyquist said.
He poured an amber splash of bourbon.
The project took him five minutes.
Take a look, he said to Selig.
Selig entered Nyquist’s mind.
That one’s mine, Nyquist said.
Now tell me if you like yours.
Sure, Selig said.
They came up for drinks.
This awful snowstorm, the blonde said, shuddering.
It can drive you crazy!
Still, there was no backing out now.
Selig grinned selfconsciously at her when they were finally alone.
Hello, he said.
Their clothes dropped away.
Her breasts rose to him like pink birds.
He caressed her with a virgin’s timid intensity.
Through conscious effort he reconstituted himself.
This has no deep significance, he told himself.
Recovering, he reached toward Nyquist and reciprocated the probe.
—How you doing, Davey?
—I got me a hot one here.
Take a look.
Selig envied Nyquist’s cool detachment.
No shame, no guilt, no hangups of any kind.
No, the redhead said.
I’m all fucked out.
I want to go to sleep.
Some other time, okay?
She fumbled for her clothes.
In vino veritas.
I remain on dead center.
Becalmed, static, anchored.
I am ebbing.
Ebbing all the time.
My tide is going out.
Green crabs scuttling about.
Do you know, I feel quite calm about it now?
About it now.
I think it started in the spring of 1974.
Little failures of input.
Tiny episodes of psychic impotence.
Or vice versa.
Inventories of the shrinkage.
What will they use my nostrils for?
I accept, I accept.
Do you see that quality of acceptance growing in me?
Make no mistake, I am sincere.
Grow old along with me!
Do you believe that?
I believe that.
I’m getting better at believing all sorts of things.
Good old Browning!
Each sting that bids not sit nor stand, but go!
Be our joys three parts pain!
Strive, and hold cheap the strain.
Such joy this morning.
And it’s all fleeing from me, all ebbing.
Going out of me from every pore.
Silence is coming over me.
I will speak to no one after it’s gone.
And no one will speak to me.
A schvartze at the wheel, drunk, giddy.
Ego, ego, ego.
I have misplaced my gift somewhere.
Will you forgive me?
Best, to forget!
Dying, we live.
Take an imaginary letter, Mr.
Miss Kitty Holstein, Something West Sixty-something Street, New York City.
Check the address later.
Don’t bother about the zipcode.
I no longer do things very well with it.
This power seems to be slipping away from me now.
It caused us so much grief, remember?
I will be a freak no longer.
I know I did dumb things then.
I pushed you mercilessly.
To you I seemed domineering, overpowering, dictatorial-me, mild self-effacing me!
Because I was trying to transform you.
And eventually I bored you.
unformed, and you resisted me.
I’m thinking seriously of entering the Roman Catholic Church.
Good Christ, am I?
That’s the first I’ve heard of that!
Or perhaps the Episcopalians, I don’t know.
It’s a matter of affiliating myself with the human race.
And also I want to fall in love again.
I want to be part of someone else.
For I will be ordinary.
For I will be very ordinary.
I wonder about you.
You’re 35 years old now, I think.
That sounds very old to me, even though I’m 41.
41 doesn’t sound old, somehow!
I still think of you as being 22.
You seemed even younger than that: sunny, open, naive.
Anyway, so you’re 35.
I imagine you look younger than that today.
Did you marry?
Of course you did.
A happy marriage?
Lots of kids?
Are you still married?
Do you ever see Tom Nyquist?
Not as a wife, not yet, just as a companion.
I need help so much.
I need love.
I’d rather reach to you in strength than in weakness.
But right now I’m weak.
I’m suffering a slow reality leakage.
Kitty I need you.
Kitty how will I find you?
Kitty I hardly knew you.
The plangent chord.
The breaking string.
The lyre untuned.
Is this an end or is it a beginning?
I think so, beloved.
Our lives are pilgrimages toward Him.
Why should we mourn?
If we lose this, do we also lose that?
If sight goes, does love go also?
Now comes a dark equinox out of its proper moment.
The bleached moon glimmers like a wretched old skull.
The leaves shrivel and fall.
The fires die down.
The dove, wearying, flutters to earth.
Everything blows away.
Our guides admit they are lost.
That which has been solid grows transparent.
Things pass away.
that addled my brains.
I phoned her office first.
No, she hadn’t been to work this week.
No, she hadn’t been in touch at all.
Was it urgent?
Would I like to have her home number?
I’m calling from her home number, I said.
She isn’t here and I don’t know where she’s gone.
This is David Selig, Teddy.
Oh, he said.
Very faintly, with great compassion.
Most of them, I knew, didn’t like me.
I didn’t have to be telepathic to realize that.
Doris, Helen, and Pam sounded sincere.
The other two, it seemed to me, were lying.
I felt dirty about spying and didn’t probe Grace.
Not in weeks, he told me, all ice.
The trail had run out.
No bodies found in Central Park lately?
In subway trash cans?
The basements of Amsterdam Avenue tenements?
So much for the police.
Children are starving in Europe, Duv.
Not my finest hour.
Jealousy, despair, humiliation, agony.
He’s that high-bracket interior decorator she always talks about.
Not to me.
One of Toni’s oldest friends.
They’re very close.
A long pause.
Then Pam chuckled warmly into my numb silence.
Oh, relax, relax, David!
He’s just a kind of father-confessor for her.
She goes to him when there’s trouble.
You two have broken up, haven’t you?
I’m not sure.
I suppose we have.
I don’t know.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Just give me his phone number, I said.
It rang and rang and rang.
At last Bob Larkin picked up.
Who teaches them to speak with the homo accent?
I asked, Is Toni there?
A guarded response: Who’s calling, please?
I told him.
It’s urgent, I said.
Please tell her it’s urgent.
Another muffled conference.
I started to wheedle, to whine, to beg.
That ought to be obvious.
I want you to come back.
She didn’t say I won’t.
She said I can’t.
I said, Would you like to tell me why?
You didn’t even leave a note.
Not a word of explanation.
You ran out so fast.
I’m sorry, David.
Let’s not talk about it, she said.
I don’t want it to be over.
A lie; she had made a clean sweep.
I offered to bring the stuff over right now.
She didn’t want me to come.
She preferred never to see me again, she told me.
Less painful all around, that way.
So I told myself.
Fool that I was.
In any case she couldn’t entirely turn me away.
Talking very fast, I bludgeoned her into yielding.
All right, she said.
But you’re wasting your time.
It was close to midnight.
No stars visible.
He radiated warmth and sympathy and kindness.
She’s in the livingroom, he said.
To the left.
Her eyes were bleak.
Her long hair was tangled.
She didn’t move as I walked toward her.
Where’s the stuff you were bringing?
There wasn’t any.
I figured that.
What went wrong, Toni?
Just don’t ask.
You shouldn’t have come here at all.
You tried to hurt me, she said.
You tried to bum-trip me.
She stubbed out her cigarette and immediately lit another.
Her eyes, somber and hooded, refused to meet mine.
So I packed and got out.
You know that isn’t true.
It was strange, she said.
It was like our minds were linked, David.
Like a telepathic channel had opened between us.
I was thinking your thoughts.
Seeing myself as you saw me.
That was what scared me.
The way our minds seemed to blur together, to overlap.
To become one.
I never knew acid could do that to people.
But the words congealed in my mouth.
They sounded insane to me.
How could I confess such stuff?
I let the moment pass.
We were a little out of our heads.
But the trip’s over.
You don’t have to hide from me now.
Come back, Toni.
In a few days, then?
I don’t understand this.
Everything’s changed, she said.
I couldn’t ever live with you now.
You scare me too much.
I still feel as if our minds are linked.
Stuff creeping out of you into my head.
I should never have touched the acid.
Carelessly she crushed her cigarette and found another.
You make me uncomfortable now.
I wish you’d go.
I’m sorry David.
I didn’t dare look into her mind.
She hadn’t stopped loving me.
No resources of mine could deal with that.
No way at all.
She seemed to have aged twenty years.
Her odd, exotic desert-princess beauty had wholly fled from her.
Ablaze with suffering, alive with anguish.
And no way for me to reach her.
All right, I said quietly.
I’m sorry too.
Not even any tears.
What shall I cry?
Again the gentle sorrowing smile from him as I emerged.
Thanks for letting me bother you this late, I said.
No trouble at all.
Too bad about you and Toni.
Her body trembling with need.
He kisses her tears away.
She thanks him gravely for his efforts.
They fall into childlike sleep, side by side.
How civilized, how tender.
My poor Toni.
I’m glad she went to you, I said.
He walked me to the elevator.
What shall I cry?
This is my cave.
Two rooms plus bathroom, kitchenette, hallway.
Things change as the city decays; regulations break down.
Kol Nidre, perhaps.
Or the Kaddish.
Would you like the guided tour of David Selig’s cave?
Please come this way.
No tipping allowed.
Welcome, folks, welcome to my humble abode.
We’ll begin our tour in the bathroom.
Leave that toothbrush alone, sonny.
All right, come with me.
Do you see these posters in the hallway?
They are artifacts of the 1960’s.
This room is the bedroom.
Don’t look so abashed, young lady!
Who are these girls?
His needs are met.
Who are you to judge?
He finds it sufficient.
I assure you, he finds it sufficient.
Please don’t sit on his bed.
Nicholas Avenue, and needed some furniture of my own.
What else is in the bedroom?
Very little of interest, I’m afraid.
A chest of drawers containing commonplace clothing.
A pair of worn slippers.
A cracked mirror: are you superstitious?
Let’s get out of here.
This room must be depressing you.
Archaic monophonic records!
Nothing that you’d be likely to whistle after one hearing.
Jules Verne, H.
Wells, Mark Twain, Dashiell Hammett at the bottom.
Sir Walter Scott.
Van Loon, The Story of Mankind.
Verrill, Great Conquerors of South and Central America.
The books of a sober, earnest, alienated little boy.
See what you could buy then for only 25¢!
Look at the prurient paintings, the garish lettering!
These science-fiction books date from that era too.
Although, thinking about angst vs.
Fellows, I have fewer bones to pick these days.
Joyce, Proust, Mann, Eliot, Pound, the old avant-garde hierarchy.
The French period: Zola, Balzac, Montaigne, Celine, Rimbaud, Baudelaire.
This thick slug of Dostoevsky occupying half a shelf.
The psychological era: Freud, Jung, Adler, Reich, Reik.
The philosophical era.
The Marxist era.
All that Koestler.
Back to literature: Conrad, Forster, Beckett.
Catch-22 and The Politics of Experience.
Here we have his files.
A treasure-trove of personalia, awaiting a biographer yet unknown.
Report cards, always with low marks for conduct.
Crudely crayoned birthday cards for his mother and father.
Date on back of photo: July 1963.
How much she looks like Toni in this picture!
How fortunate for D.
What else do we find in these archives?
The carbon copies of innumerable letters.
Some of them are quite impersonal missives.
Dear President Eisenhower.
Dear Pope John.
Dear Secretary-General Hammarskjold.
Shall we look at a few of these documents?
Permit me to disagree.
Can one expect more?
Am I too literate for you, Mr.
Listen to the anguish in the land.
Malraux…dear…dear…dear…A remarkable collection of correspondence, you must agree.
With equally remarkable replies.
In my own experiences with the absurd…Dear Mr.
Justice Holmes: In Southern Pacific Co.
Jensen, 244 U.
What can you tell us about this Beverly, Selig?
Maybe that was why she scowled so much.
I wasn’t jealous of him.
How then to score?
Was she shocked and disturbed?
My son the pornographer.
He is not proud of that period.
Wouldn’t you like to read these letters, you stinking voyeurs?
But you won’t.
You won’t get your paws on them.
Why have I invited you in here, anyway?
It must be that my sense of self is slipping.
But that doesn’t mean I have to show you everything.
Hey, here’s a letter to Amy!
Anybody’s first time has an irresistible fascination.
Well, fuck you: I don’t feel like discussing it.
It isn’t much of a story anyway.
Where’s Amy now?
How do you like that?
His first lay, and he’s outlived her already.
Catapulted through the windshield and into a tree.
Amy’s dead and Beverly’s a pudgy middle-aged housewife, I bet.
Puckered lips, baby-blue eyes.
Summer of 1952.
How did it end?
Cured me of my fixation.
So long ago, so unreal to me now, Jackie.
Spy on me.
My fervid frenzied outpourings of love.
Read them all, what do I care?
Donna, Elsie, Magda, Mona, Sue, Lois, Karen.
Did you think I was sexually deprived?
I quarried for my life between their thighs.
Dear Connie, what a wild night that was!
Dear Chiquita, your perfume still lingers in the air.
Which it now has.
This one’s too painful.
What the hell are you doing reading someone else’s mail?
Don’t you have any decency?
I can’t show you this.
The tour’s over.
For Christ’s sake, get out!
There was always the danger of being found out.
He knew he had to be on his guard.
Even Miss Mueller, his biology teacher.
She really grooved behind the irrational, the unknown.
She had done time inside orgone boxes.
Poor silly gullible pitiful old bitch.
Rhine was doing down at Duke University.
It terrified David whenever she spoke of this.
Inevitable, the progression toward disaster.
A child’s garden of synapses.
Oh, the joy of Miss Mueller!
Her lumpy face glowing.
David wanted to hide under his desk.
The word telepathy made him wince.
Now a flash of wild paranoia.
Certainly these were irrational fears.
Would Miss Mueller now blow his cover, though?
Oh where can I hide?
She had her cards with her the next day.
Another name for them is ESP cards.
Who can tell me what ESP’ means?
Norman Heimlich’s stubby hand waving in the air.
Extrasensory perception, Miss Mueller!
Very good, Norman.
Absentmindedly she began to shuffle the cards.
Her eyes, normally inexpressive, gleamed with a Las Vegas intensity.
Otherwise they look just like ordinary playing cards.
The test can be run in many different ways.
Five, Miss Mueller?
Of course, the results are never that neat.
That is, if pure chance is the only factor operating.
And certain subjects have done much better.
The odds against that are fantastic.
One of the hands belonged to David Selig.
He was merely trying to don protective coloration.
Miss Mueller said, Let’s run a few tests today.
Victor, will you be our first guinea pig?
Come to the front of the room.
Grinning nervously, Victor Schlitz shambled forward.
Class, don’t say anything.
Barbara checked the square.
Miss Mueller glanced at the next card.
Star, David thought.
Waves, Victor said.
Barbara checked the star.
Miss Mueller, glaring, called for silence.
Waves was what Barbara checked.
Square, David agreed.
Another ripple, more subdued.
Victor went through the deck.
Miss Mueller had kept score: four correct hits.
Not even as good as chance.
She put him through a second round.
Miss Mueller’s eyes roved the room.
Let it not be me, David prayed.
God, let it not be me.
She summoned Sheldon Feinberg.
He hit five the first time, six the second.
Then Alice Cohen.
Four and four.
Stony soil, Miss Mueller.
Miss Mueller said.
David shrank into his seat.
How much longer until the dismissal bell?
Norman waddled toward the teacher’s desk.
She glanced at a card.
David, scanning her, picked up the image of a star.
What was this?
Did the odious Heimlich have a shred of the power?
Circle, Norman murmured.
Fat Heimlich had the vestiges of the gift.
He scored a seven, though, the best so far.
The bell, David prayed.
The bell, the bell, the bell!
Twenty minutes away.
A small mercy.
Miss Mueller briskly distributed test paper.
She would run the whole class at once.
I’ll call numbers from 1 to 25, she said.
David saw a circle.
Waves, he wrote.
But it was too late for that.
He went on missing.
Number one: circle.
Number two: star.
Number three: waves.
Tensely she called for results.
Had anyone scored ten hits or more?
Norman Heimlich had seven again.
He preened himself: Heimlich the mind-reader.
Four students had six.
Miss Mueller diligently jotted down the results.
Any other figures?
Sidney Goldblatt began to snicker.
Miss Mueller, how about zero?
She looked startled.
Was there someone who got all 25 cards wrong?
David Selig did!
David Selig wanted to drop through the floor.
All eyes were on him.
Cruel laughter assailed him.
David Selig got them all wrong.
Extremely strong ESP abilities.
David, let me see your answers.
I wasn’t getting anything, Miss Mueller.
Let me see.
But the randomness of his deliberately wrong answers protected him.
Nothing significant there.
Nevertheless, Miss Mueller would not let go.
I’d like to test you again, she said.
We’ll run several kinds of trials.
A null score is fascinating.
She began to shuffle the deck.
God, God, God, where are you?
Saved by the bell!
Can you stay after class?
In agony, he shook his head.
Got to go to geometry next, Miss Mueller.
We’ll run the tests tomorrow.
Would Miss Mueller forget about the test?
Miss Mueller had not forgotten.
The fateful cards were on her desk.
There would be no escape.
He found himself the center of all attention.
All right, Duv, be cleverer this time.
Are you ready to begin?
she asked, tipping up the first card.
He saw a plus sign in her mind.
Square, he said.
He saw a circle.
Waves, he said.
He saw another circle.
Plus, he said.
He saw a star.
Circle, he said.
He saw a square.
Square, he said.
He kept careful count.
Four wrong answers, then a right one.
Three wrong answers, another right one.
On the second he had four.
On the third, six.
On the fourth, four.
Am I being too average, he wondered?
Should I give her a one-hit run, now?
But she was losing interest.
He tried to look disappointed.
Sorry, teach, I ain’t got no ESP.
Humbly the deficient boy made his way to his seat.
But I didn’t have the guts to do it.
I had to look after my own skin, Miss Mueller.
I had to keep a low profile.
Will you forgive me?
One touch from me.
In a moment.
In the twinkling of an eye.
Let’s do it in short takes.
It hurts less that way.
The free world is choosing its new maximum leader.
The sound-trucks rumble along Broadway, belching slogans.
Our next President!
The man for all America!
Vote for X!
Vote for Y!
The hollow words merge and blur and flow.
Why should I vote?
I will not vote.
I do not vote.
I am not plugged in.
I am not part of the circuit.
Voting is for them.
in a dark black limousine rode Richard M.
My big chance at last, I thought.
Today I stay home from the polls.
Let them elect the next President without my help.
A party, she says.
Everybody’ll be there.
The host is Claude Guermantes.
Do you know him?
Professor of French Literature.
No, the name is not Guermantes.
I have changed the name to protect the guilty.
He’s one of those charismatic new professors.
Karl and I are coming.
And a lot of others.
He always invites the most interesting people.
Simone de Beauvoir?
Will they be there?
No, silly, not them.
But it’ll be worth your time.
Claude gives the best parties of anybody I know.
Brilliant combinations of people.
Sounds like a vampire to me.
He gives as well as takes, Duv.
He specifically asked me to invite you.
How does he know me at all?
Through me, she says.
I’ve talked of you.
He’s dying to meet you.
I don’t like parties.
I know that warning tone of voice.
I have no stomach for a hassle just now.
All right, I say, sighing.
Give me the address.
Why am I so pliable?
Why do I let Judith manipulate me?
Thursday, I do two paragraphs for Yahya Lumumba.
He might just loathe it.
If I ever finish it.
I must finish it.
Never missed a deadline yet.
Don’t dare to.
In the PM I walk up to the 230th St.
Attractive in a vacant-eyed way.
What a sudden blazing communion, soul to soul!
She streams fire.
No dumb pallid mannequin now.
A dark curtain falls.
I am disconnected.
My grip on her consciousness is severed.
Silence, that terrible mental silence, rushes to enfold me.
in that sweet fluting little-girl voice.
Wake up with aches, high fever.
Undoubtedly an attack of psychosomatic ague.
The angry, embittered mind mercilessly flagellating the defenseless body.
Chills followed by hot sweats followed by chills.
I feel hollow.
Headpiece filled with straw.
Sick as a dog.
I read my minor metaphysicals.
Some of them not so minor.
Traherne, Crashaw, William Cartwright.
Did quickly enter and my Soul enflame.
That maketh Heav’n: ’Tis a clearer Sight.
Appears to none but them that purely see.
Threw up again after that.
Not to be interpreted as an expression of criticism.
Felt better for a while.
I should call Judith.
Have her make some chicken soup for me.
Veh is mir.
Veh is mir, in spades.
Remember, remember, the sixth of November.
At last the familiar Columbia station.
where Claude Guermantes is reputed to live.
I stand hesitantly outside.
Dead leaves swirling in the park.
Inside, a mahogany doorman eyes me fishily.
He jerks a thumb.
Seventh floor, 7-G.
Waving me toward the elevator.
I’m late; it’s almost ten o’clock.
Not that posters are necessary.
I ring the bell.
Too loud for them to hear me.
I’d announce myself in tones of thunder.
Ring again, more aggressively.
Nudity a la mode.
Flashes her teeth gaily.
Come in, come in, come in!
A mob scene.
Super hash, he explains.
Just in from Damascus.
Come on, man, toke up!
I suck smoke willy-nilly and feel an immediate effect.
Yeah, my benefactor shouts.
It’s got the power to cloud men’s minds, don’t it?
Oh, here I am, Duvid!
Judith looks sexy tonight.
I feel pride in her beauty.
She is flanked by two impressive-looking men.
On one side is Dr Karl F.
Silvestri, author of Studies in the Physiology of Thermoregulation.
Bigger, too—perhaps six feet five.
He radiates something avuncular or even paternal toward her.
His mind is quicksilver, a glittering, shimmering pool.
He thinks in three or four languages at once.
His rampaging energy exhausts me at a single touch.
a scarlet sash, flaring satin trousers, turned-up pointed-toed medieval boots.
May still be.
I am shy about probing that.
I’d like you to meet my brother David, Judith says.
I’ve heard so much about you, Mr.
Have you really?
I’ve got this freak of a brother, Karl.
Would you believe it, he can actually read minds?
How much has Judith actually revealed about me?
I’ll try to probe him and see.
And call me David.
You’re Dr Silvestri, right?
I’d prefer Karl.
I’ve heard a lot about you from Jude, I say.
No go on the probe.
His mind is opaque to me.
My head starts to throb.
She showed me two of your books.
I wish I could understand things like that.
A pleased chuckle from lofty Silvestri.
Judith meanwhile has begun to introduce me to Guermantes.
He murmurs his delight at making any acquaintance.
Something strange, a mixture, Franco-Italic, maybe, or Franco-Hispanic.
His semen now curdles within her.
No hope, professor.
I will not be added to your Selig collection.
He asks me pleasantly about my degrees.
Just one, I say.
A compliment, in the froggish sense.
A girl accosts me at the liquor table.
One of Guermantes’ students, no more than 20.
Not beautiful but somehow interesting.
I just got here.
You look like you’re fun to fuck.
Do you say that to everybody you’ve just met?
We haven’t even met, she points out.
And no, I don’t say it to everybody.
To lots, though.
Girls can take the initiative these days.
Besides, it’s leap year.
Are you a poet?
You look like one.
I bet you’re sensitive and you suffer a lot.
My familiar dopy fantasy, coming to life before my eyes.
Her eyes are red-rimmed.
An acrid smell of sweat rising from her black sweater.
Probably she’s got the clap.
Is she putting me on?
I bet you’re sensitive and you suffer a lot.
Are you a poet?
What’s your name?
The name triggers me.
Kitty, Kitty, Kitty!
Is that what you said?
Holstein, yes, and spare me the cow jokes.
Do you have a sister named Kitty?
Catherine, I guess.
About 35 years old.
Never heard of her.
Someone you know?
Used to know, I say.
I pick up my drink and turn away.
Hey, she calls after me.
Did you think I was kidding?
A black colossus confronts me.
Immense Afro nimbus, terrifying jungle face.
His clothing a sunburst of clashing colors.
Just who I most need to see.
What is he doing here?
The evening’s token black, perhaps.
A stunning couple.
They shame us all with their beauty.
Lumumba says, finally, I know you, man.
I know you from someplace.
Where do I know you?
Euripides, Sophocles, and Aeschylus.
What the fuck?
That fucking term paper.
How you coming along on that, man?
You gonna have it Wednesday?
Wednesday when it due.
I’ll have it, Mr.
Doin’ my best, massa.
You better, boy.
I counting on you.
Who said Tom Nyquist just then?
Who was it who spoke his name?
I look for likely owners of that voice.
Men all around.
No way of telling.
Yes, one way.
The effort is murderously great.
But I enter.
I seek the proper reverberations.
Who spoke his name?
Excuse me, I say.
He and I were once very close.
I’m sure I heard you mention him.
A blank smile.
I’m afraid there’s been a mistake.
I don’t know anyone by that name.
Can you help?
But I’m positive I heard— The echo.
Boum in the cave.
Was I mistaken?
But I can’t function at all, now.
They are conferring earnestly.
Did anybody hear a Nyquist mentioned?
Does anyone know a Nyquist?
One of them suddenly cries: John Leibnitz!
Yes, says the plump one happily.
Maybe that’s who you heard me mention.
I was talking about John Leibnitz a few moments ago.
A mutual friend.
Quite possibly, I agree.
No doubt that’s what happened.
Silly of me.
Sorry to have bothered you.
Do come around.
You’ll be on campus Wednesday, won’t you?
I’ll be on campus, yes.
I’d better be.
But how does Guermantes know that?
Is he getting into my head somehow?
What if he has the gift too?
I shake these useless idiocies away.
I expect to be around on Wednesday, yes.
Perhaps I will drop in.
I’d love it if you came, he tells me.
He leans close to me.
I smell hair tonic, shaving lotion, deodorant, and other perfumes.
Your sister, he murmurs.
How I love her!
She speaks often of you.
With great love.
Also with great guilt.
It seems you and she were estranged for many years.
That’s over now.
We’re finally becoming friends.
How wonderful for you both.
He gestures with a flick of his eyes.
No good for her.
Too old, too static.
After fifty most men lose the capacity to grow.
He’ll bore her to death in six months.
Maybe boredom is what she needs, I reply.
She’s had an exciting life.
It hasn’t made her happy.
No one ever needs boredom, Guermantes says, and winks.
There’s so much we three need to talk about.
I’ll see, Jude.
I’m not sure about anything about next week yet.
I’ll call you.
I think I need another drink.
Hash, rum, wine, pot, God knows what else.
That filthy fucking party.
I should never have gone.
My head, my head, my head.
Where’s the typewriter?
I’ve got to get some work done.
No damned good.
Save it for later.
Silence between my ears.
The echoing black void.
I have nothing going for me at all today, nothing.
I think it may be completely gone.
I’m living an Eliot poem.
I’m turning into words on a page.
Shall I sit here feeling sorry for myself?
I’ll fight back.
Spiritual exercises designed to restore my power.
On your knees, Selig.
Bow the head.
That sharp pure mental beam piercing the universe.
Hold it firm.
No spreading at the edges allowed, man.
We are climbing Jacob’s ladder.
This will be an out-of-the-body experience, Duvid.
Up, up and away!
Into the vacant interstellar spaces.
O dark dark dark.
Cold the sense and lost the motive of action.
No, stop that stuff!
Only positive thinking is allowed on this trip.
Toward the little green men of Betelgeuse IX.
Reach their minds, Selig.
Soar, you lazy yid-bastard!
Why aren’t you soaring?
Tumbling back to earth.
Into the silent funeral.
All right, give up, if that’s what you want.
Rest, for a little while.
Rest and then pray, Selig.
The hangover gone.
The brain once again receptive.
As I hammer out the final words the telephone rings.
Nicely timed; I feel sociable now.
It is Lisa Holstein who calls.
What the hell did you do, sneak away?
How did you get my number?
That sleek devil.
He knows everything.
Look, what are you doing right now?
Thinking about having a shower.
What kind of work do you do?
I ghostwrite term papers for Columbia men.
She ponders that a moment.
You sure have a weird head, man.
I mean really: what do you do?
I just told you.
A long digestive silence.
I can dig it.
You ghostwrite term papers.
Look, Dave, go take your shower.
Maybe forty minutes, if you get a train right away.
See you in an hour, then.
A crazy broad.
Dave, she calls me.
Nobody calls me Dave.
Stripping, I head for the shower, a long leisurely soaping.
Let’s hope Lumumba does too.
Then I pick up the Updike book.
I get to page four and the phone rings again.
This is more than a joke, now.
Why is she pursuing me so singlemindedly?
I can play her game.
I give her the instructions.
Ten minutes later, a knock on the door.
A shy grin, strangely out of character for her.
Hi, she says.
Making herself comfortable.
Make it with him.
Her sweater is off by now.
A Jewish star nestles in the deep valley between them.
So tell me, she says.
Now that I’m here.
Was I right?
Is there anything special about you?
There once was.
It’s a brutal frontal assault, a rape, a true mindfuck.
Of course she doesn’t feel a thing.
I say, I used to have a really extraordinary gift.
Far out, she says, and drops her jeans.
She will be fat before she’s 30.
Her thighs are thick, her belly protrudes.
Her buttocks are deeply dimpled.
I don’t need to be polite.
I owe her nothing: she forced herself on me.
The truth: Kitty is no kin to her.
A meaningless coincidence of surnames, is all.
That’s an intuition flash too.
I run my hands over her breasts and belly.
A sharp odor comes from her skin.
She hasn’t washed in three or four days, I bet.
Her nipples mysteriously emerge, tiny rigid pink nubs.
Her autobiography assembles itself for me.
Born in Cambridge.
Twenty years old.
Father a professor.
Mother a professor.
One younger brother.
Measles, chicken pox, scarlet fever.
Puberty at eleven, lost her virginity at twelve.
Abortion at sixteen.
Several Lesbian adventures.
Passionate interest in French decadent poets.
Acid, mescaline, psilocybin, cocaine, even a sniff of smack.
Guermantes gave her that.
Guermantes also took her to bed five or six times.
Vivid memories of that.
He’s hung very impressively.
Not a bad kid.
But I have my needs.
I can hardly remember the last time anyone did that.
She’s an expert fellatrice.
Selig the stallion.
Selig the stud.
Oooh, she says, flexing her knees.
And we begin to play the beast with two backs.
But then a funny thing happens.
The images break up in a pounding of static.
She is jolted by that, caught by surprise.
What brought you down?
I find it impossible to tell her.
Sometimes yes, I told her.
He is impotent here and he is impotent there.
I guess I got distracted, I tell her.
I don’t understand it, she says.
You were doing so well.
Was there something about me that brought you down?
I reassure her.
You were great, baby.
Stuff like this sometimes just happens, no one knows why.
Not a flicker on the telepathic level.
Not a flicker.
The silence of the tomb.
Is this it, the end, right here and now?
Is this where it finally burns out?
And I am like all the rest of you now.
I am condemned to make do with mere words.
I have an idea, she says.
Let’s take a shower together.
That sometimes peps a guy up.
We head for the bathroom.
Torrents of brisk cool water.
The ministrations of her soapy hand revive me.
We spring toward the bed.
Still stiff, I top her and take her.
Gasp gasp gasp, moan moan moan.
I can get nothing on the mental band.
So much for sex.
We curl up together, cuddly in the after-glow.
I try again to probe her.
Is it gone?
I think it’s really gone.
The perishing of a remarkable extrasensory power.
Leaving behind this merely mortal husk of mine.
Monday night, about seven-thirty.
Lisa has left, finally.
I go out for dinner, to a nearby pizzeria.
I am quite calm.
How strange that I can be so accepting.
But for now I’m surprisingly cool.
An oddly posthumous feeling, as of having outlived myself.
Of course I don’t expect this mood to last.
But it seems that my mourning must be postponed.
What I thought was all over isn’t over yet.
Reading him clearly.
So it’s not dead yet!
Not quite dead!
Only resting a while.
I finish two more term papers for delivery tomorrow.
I read Updike.
Judith calls after lunch.
The usual dinner invitation.
My usual oblique reply.
What did you think of Karl?
A very substantial man.
He wants me to marry him.
It’s too soon.
I don’t really know him, Duv.
Then don’t rush into anything with him, I say.
Her soap-opera hesitations bore me.
Why should love require a contract?
Why invite lawyers to fuck around with your assets?
I don’t think he could dig it.
You know about me and Claude?
You always know everything.
This was pretty obvious, Jude.
I thought your power was waning.
It is, it is, it’s waning faster than ever.
But this was still pretty obvious.
To the naked eye.
What did you think of him?
He’s a killer.
You misjudged him, Duv.
I was in his head.
I saw him, Jude.
He isn’t human.
People are toys to him.
Am I that incestuous?
You always were, she says.
But let that pass.
I really thought you’d enjoy meeting Claude.
I think cobras are fascinating too.
Oh, fuck you, Duv.
You want me to pretend I liked him?
Don’t do me any favors.
The old icy Judith.
What’s Karl’s reaction to Guermantes?
Finally: Pretty negative.
Karl’s very conventional, you know.
Just as you are.
Oh, you’re so fucking straight, Duv!
You’re such a puritan!
You’ve been lecturing me on morality all my goddamned life.
Why doesn’t Karl like him?
I don’t know.
He thinks Claude’s sinister.
Her voice is suddenly flat and dull.
Maybe he’s just jealous.
He knows I’m still sleeping with Claude.
Oh, Jesus, Duv, why are we fighting again?
Why can’t we just talk?
I’m not the one who’s fighting.
I’m not the one who raised his voice.
You’re challenging me.
That’s what you always do.
Old habits are hard to break, Jude.
Really, though: I’m not angry with you.
You sound so smug!
I’m not angry.
Listen, Jude, do whatever you want.
If Guermantes is your trip, go ahead.
I don’t know.
I just don’t know.
Her flinty self-assurance vanishes abruptly.
Now, softening, thawing, she sounds uncertain of herself.
Will you come to dinner next week?
We very much do want to get together with you.
I’m worried about you, Duv.
Yes, here it comes.
You looked so strung out on Saturday night.
It’s been a pretty rough time for me.
But I’ll manage.
I don’t feel like talking about myself.
Listen, I’ll call you soon, okay?
Are you still in so much pain, Duv?
I’m accepting the whole thing.
I mean, I’ll be okay.
Keep in touch, Jude.
My best to Karl.
And Claude, I add, as I put down the receiver.
Downtown to deliver my latest batch of masterpieces.
How dry the world seems.
The humidity is minus sixteen percent, I think.
Thrashing about randomly in your death-throes.
I go to the usual place and await my clients.
David Selig, benefactor of undergraduate mankind.
Why am I trembling?
I feel a sense of participation in his glory.
When the season starts maybe I’ll go watch him play.
You got the paper, man?
I deal it off the stack.
Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides.
He sits down beside me on the steps.
I got to read this fucker first, right?
I watch him as he reads.
He gnaws his lip.
He reads faster and faster, impatiently turning the pages.
This is shit, man, he says.
I mean, this here is just shit.
What kind of con you trying to pull?
I guarantee you’ll get a B+.
No, listen to me.
Who talking about grades?
I can’t turn this fucking thing in at all.
Crazy shit, that’s what.
You think I a dummy, Lumumba?
You don’t believe Word One of this.
Angrily he rises.
Here, I going to read you some of this, man.
I show you what you give me.
Leafing through the pages, he scowls, spits, shakes his head.
Why the hell should I?
You know what you up to here, man?
You making fun of me, that’s what.
You playing games with the dumb nigger, man.
You pulling a mindfuck, man.
That’s a lie.
How long this take you?
Eight hours, maybe ten, I say.
You know what I think you’re trying to do, Lumumba?
You’re pulling reverse racism on me.
Why didn’t you write it yourself?
I did an honest job for you.
I gonna get flunked, is what.
Maybe you just don’t see what I was driving at.
Let me try to explain it to you.
I’d need a ladder to reach it.
No use jumping.
Come on, damn it, don’t play games with me!
Let me have it!
Dying, I watch them go.
I want to smash his mocking face in.
You shouldn’t have done that.
You shouldn’t have just thrown it away.
You owe me my five bucks back, man.
Hold on, now.
You said you don’t charge if the paper’s no good.
Okay, the paper was shit.
Give me the five.
You aren’t playing fair, Lumumba.
You’re trying to rip me off.
Who ripping who off?
Who set up that money-back deal anyhow?
What I gonna do for a term paper now?
I got to take an incomplete and it your fault.
Look, man, you make me want to puke.
Give me the five.
Is he serious about the refund?
I can’t tell.
I say, What is this, slavery turned upside down?
I did the work.
I’m going to keep the five.
At least the five.
Give me the money, man.
Go to hell.
I start to walk away.
He starts to shake me.
My teeth are rattling.
I start to yell.
A crowd is gathering.
Laughing, whooping, cavorting.
I am a toy to them.
Hey, man, he bothering you?
one of them asks.
You need help, Yahya?
What’s the mothafuck honkie doing to you, man?
calls a third.
Around and around and around.
An elbow explodes against my lip.
I taste blood.
Someone slaps me, and my head rockets backward.
Fingers jabbing my ribs.
They continue to whirl me from one to the next.
Not slapping now, not jabbing, but punching.
Where are the campus police?
Pigs to the rescue!
But no one comes.
I can’t catch my breath.
The world spins wildly.
The steady pounding, the blur of unending motion.
Please, someone, anyone, help me, stop them.
I can’t see.
I can only feel.
Where are my feet?
I’m falling at last.
Look how fast the steps rush toward me.
The cold kiss of the stone bruises my cheek.
I may already have lost consciousness; how can I tell?
There’s one comfort, at least.
I can’t get any further down than this.
Or perhaps not.
Atmospheric nuclear tests had just been banned.
The Washington-to-Moscow hot line was being set up.
This was Tom Nyquist’s idea.
But Nyquist didn’t do things that way.
Selig protested that he knew nothing about Wall Street.
I could teach you everything in three days, said Nyquist.
Actually it took less than that.
Selig memorized all of it.
The next step was to enroll as a trainee.
Selig picked one at random and applied.
He got a perfect score and was hired.
He wondered what he would do next.
Luck delivered Kitty to him.
Then the door opened and somebody’s beautiful granddaughter came in.
No, not a beautiful girl, but certainly pretty.
Refreshing to look at.
She’s here fifty years too early.
He got nothing.
That shocked him.
It was an incredible experience.
He got no aura from her at all.
I said, I’d like to open a brokerage account.
Are you a broker?
What do you want?
Selig asked her.
I don’t know.
I don’t know the first thing about the market.
I just don’t want to do anything silly.
Selig had no stomach for such maneuvers.
There, he said.
Now you have a portfolio.
You’re a capitalist.
But he took the chance.
What are you doing this evening?
I get out of here at four o’clock.
She was free, she said.
Except that she worked from eleven to six.
You lucky bastard, Nadel said.
What did you do, make a date with her?
Selig only laughed.
You covered too soon, Nyquist said immediately.
She’ll drop five or six more points this week.
The smart money’s waiting for that.
I’m not that greedy.
I’ll settle for the quick three bills.
That’s no way to get rich.
I guess I lack the gambling instinct, Selig said.
He hadn’t really called Nyquist to talk about shorting Molybdenum.
I met a girl, I met a girl.
Sudden fears held him back.
He’ll laugh at me, Selig thought.
But this is foolishness.
He said, Tom, something strange happened today.
A girl came into the office, a very attractive girl.
I’m seeing her tonight.
The thing is, I was entirely unable to read her.
I mean, I couldn’t even pick up an aura.
Blank, absolutely blank.
I’ve never had that with anybody before.
I don’t think so.
A complete blank.
I can’t understand it.
What could account for her having such a strong screen?
Maybe you’re tired today, Nyquist suggested.
I can read everybody else, same as always.
Just not her.
Does that irritate you?
Of course it does.
Why do you say of course?
It seemed obvious to Selig.
A way of passing time.
He wished he hadn’t phoned.
Brusquely Selig said, I’m—well, very interested in her.
I don’t like that phrase.
Whose phrase is it?
That’s how you regard what we do, isn’t it?
You feel guilty about spying on people, right?
I suppose, Selig admitted sullenly.
You make it sound so evil, Tom.
What do you want me to say?
I don’t want you to say anything.
I don’t, Nyquist said.
Not off the top of my head.
All right, then.
But Nyquist wasn’t finished.
That possibility had occurred to Selig a moment earlier.
He found it deeply disturbing.
I’ll do that, Selig said without enthusiasm.
One of these days soon, he said.
Look, all the phones are lighting up.
I’ll be in touch, Tom.
Give her one for me, said Nyquist.
Selig Studies 101, Prof.
In Gibbs’ universe order is least probable, chaos most probable.
Life finds its home in some of these enclaves.
Human beings, says Wiener, carry on anti-entropic processes.
We have sensory receptors.
We communicate with one another.
We make use of what we learn from one another.
We, as human beings, are not isolated systems.
There is feedback, in other words.
A hermit, say.
He lives in a dark cave.
No information penetrates.
He eats mushrooms.
This condition is known as death.
One doesn’t have to hide in a cave.
There are married people who strive fiercely to reach equilibrium.
I call this the monogamous fallacy.
Of course, Judith’s a slut.
The sensory shutdown is not always a willed event, naturally.
It happens to us whether we like it or not.
Sight, hearing, touch, smell—everything goes, as good old Will S.
I offer myself as a case in point.
What does this man’s sad history reveal?
An inexplicable diminution of once-remarkable powers.
A shrinkage of the inputs.
A small death, endured while he still lives.
Am I not a casualty of the entropic wars?
Is my distress not evident and poignant?
I am dying the heat death.
A spontaneous decay.
A random twitch of probability undoes me.
And I am made into nothingness.
I am becoming cinders and ash.
That’s very eloquent, Selig.
Take an A.
You may go to the head of the class.
Do you feel better now?
It was a crazy idea, Kitty, a dumb fantasy.
It could never have worked.
I was asking the impossible from you.
Well, blame Tom Nyquist.
It was his idea.
No, blame me.
I doubt that very much, I told him.
She doesn’t have a shred of telepathic ability, I insisted.
She’s completely normal.
Don’t be so sure, Nyquist said.
He hadn’t met you yet.
You had never heard his name.
Therefore she’s no mindreader.
Because mindreaders are insane, unhealthy, and unbalanced.
Like you and like me.
Speak for yourself, man.
The gift tips the spirit, I said.
It darkens the soul.
He was right about that.
Telepathy hadn’t injured him.
Some telepaths are not neurotic.
Some neurotics are not telepaths.
Therefore telepathy and neurosis aren’t necessarily related.
You can seem cherry-pie normal and still have the power.
I remained skeptical of this.
Just a hypothesis, he said.
But it tickled me with temptation.
Suppose she’s got this latent power, I said.
Could it be awakened, do you think?
I was willing to believe it.
How intense our love would be, then!
If I could only awaken you, Kitty!
And why not?
I asked Nyquist if he thought it might be possible.
Try it and find out, he said.
It’s worth trying, isn’t it?
Yes, I said, of course it’s worth trying.
An air of adolescence surrounded you.
I would be your Pygmalion.
In September of 1963 you moved in with me.
The warmth of you beside me in bed every night.
My belly against your smooth cool butt, yang and yin.
I gave you books to read: poetry, novels, essays.
How diligently you devoured them!
A hopeless case, I sometimes thought.
Different worlds, different kinds of mind.
Yet I always had hope of creating a bridge.
And I had to pretend.
My strategy didn’t allow for any true confessions.
Just a hobby, then.
You couldn’t bring yourself to believe in ESP.
Be tolerant, I pleaded.
There are such things as telepathic powers.
I know there are.
Be careful, Duv!
But I could offer other arguments.
How can you explain them, if not by ESP?
concentrate on transmitting images or ideas to one another.
You had no direct hits.
Flowers, buildings, heavy-duty equipment, means of transportation.
Enough to give us false hopes of true transmission.
No direct hits for me either.
And we went onward.
We varied the conditions for thought transmission.
We tried doing it in absolute darkness, one room apart.
We tried it with the lights on, holding hands.
We tried it drunk.
We tried it fasting.
All this mind-reading, you said, left you with woeful headaches.
But I couldn’t give up, Kitty.
I overrode your objections and insisted we go on.
We would break through; we would touch each other’s minds.
How could I quit now, when we were so close?
But we were never close.
We came late: you were slow getting ready.
I introduced you to Nyquist.
What do you think of her.
I had to seek my own answers in his skull.
At once I acquired the knowledge I wanted and dreaded.
He could read you.
To him you were as transparent as anyone else.
That’s how he really saw you.
The discovery numbed me.
Jealousy curdled me.
I was instantly suspicious.
Nyquist and his malicious games: was this yet one more?
Could he read you?
—You don’t trust me?
Of course I’m reading her.
—Maybe yes, maybe no.
—Do you want me to prove it?
It was no glimpse I ever wanted.
I saw myself through your eyes through his mind.
No doubt that you responded to my body.
But the emotional associations!
Read this, read that, improve your mind, girl!
Study hard to be worthy of me!
Night after night to be bugged by monomaniacal me.
How sick you were of me, Kitty!
How monstrously dull you thought me!
An instant of such revelation was more than enough.
Stung, I retreated, pulling away quickly from Nyquist.
Nyquist shot me a sardonic smile.
I couldn’t meet his eyes.
But even then I resisted what he had showed me.
Was he not shading and coloring it?
Introducing sly distortions and magnifications?
I imagined you were discussing me and not being complimentary.
—Get out of my head, will you?
Just having a little fun.
And now there would be a President Johnson.
Could I adapt?
I cling to zones of stability.
Paranoia was general everywhere.
No one lingered in the open; everyone hurried toward shelter.
Anything might happen now.
Packs of wolves might burst out of Riverside Drive.
Maddened patriots might launch a pogrom.
The telephone lines were choked.
I gave up the attempt after twenty minutes.
The note was dated 10:30 A.
before the assassination, in another era.
Toward evening I telephoned Nyquist.
This time the lines were open.
Is Kitty there?
Yes, he said.
Just a minute.
And put you on.
He had been very helpful.
So you had gone to him for comfort and love.
You didn’t answer.
I have no idea what became of either of you.
Probably I’ll never know.
I loved you, lady, in my clumsy way.
I love you now.
And you are lost to me forever.
Evidently this is St.
Luke’s, perhaps the emergency room.
He has spent relatively little time in hospitals.
Carefully he sits up.
A tumult of impressions strikes him.
The beds have curtains but no curtains are drawn.
Mutilated by knives?
Lacerated by windshields?
His fingertips explore his cheeks.
His mind is foggy.
In the morning?
In the afternoon?
Probably the afternoon, he decides.
Selig’s own stomach sends him no hunger signals.
Will they feed him this evening?
How long will he be kept here?
Should he ask that Judith be notified?
How badly has he been injured?
Surprisingly, he comes right to Selig.
We are ready to authorize your release.
Please get up.
Wait, Selig says feebly.
I just came to.
I don’t know what’s been going on.
Who brought me here?
How long have I been unconscious?
I know none of these things.
On your feet, now.
I have much to do.
Or did I spend the night here?
What day is today?
Ponderously Selig climbs from the bed.
His body seems to be held together with wire.
His bones grind and scrape.
He starts to ask, but too late.
They bring him his clothing.
He pulls the curtain around his bed and dresses.
He checks his belongings: everything here, wallet, wristwatch, pocket-comb.
Just walk out?
Nothing to sign?
Selig edges uncertainly toward the door.
He actually gets into the corridor unperceived.
What security man?
He acknowledges that he is.
The dean wants to see you.
I’ll walk, Selig says.
The security man stays close beside him, saying nothing.
Why is that?
An odd thought.
What does he have to fear from the dean?
He wonders who the dean is, these days.
McKnight, a fraternity enthusiast Sigma Chi?
with a formal, distinctly nineteenth-century manner, was Dean of Students.
But that was twenty years ago.
Go on in, the security man says.
A fine deanly name.
Who is he?
Are you dean now, Ted?
Christ, I wouldn’t have guessed that.
Did you get badly hurt?
The hospital says nothing’s broken.
I feel half ruined, though.
Talking is an effort; his jaws creak at their hinges.
Hey, Ted, it’s been a long time!
Must be twenty years since I last saw you.
You can have that in writing if you’d like.
The verbal commitment is fine.
For getting mauled by your basketball players?
For damaging their expensive hands with my face?
He essays a painful grin.
Cushing’s face remains grave.
There is a little moment of silence.
Selig struggles to interpret Cushing’s joke.
But he runs into a wall.
I don’t understand what you mean, he says finally.
Press charges for what?
For these, Dave.
Cushing nudges them forward.
Do you recognize them?
Here: take a look.
Selig leafs unhappily through them.
They are term papers, all of them of his manufacture.
Odysseus as a Symbol of Society.
The Novels of Kafka.
Aeschylus and the Aristotelian Tragedy.
Resignation and Acceptance in the Philosophy of Montaigne.
Virgil as Dante’s Mentor.
All right, he says.
You’ve got me.
Did you write those?
For a fee?
That’s sad, Dave.
That’s awfully sad.
I needed to earn a living.
They don’t give scholarships to alumni.
What were you getting paid for these things?
Three or four bucks a typed page.
Cushing shakes his head.
You were good, I’ll give you credit for that.
But you had one dissatisfied customer, at least.
We asked Lumumba why he beat you up.
There wasn’t a great deal of cooperation.
But we cared, Dave.
We cared very much.
Cushing leans forward.
His eyes, terribly earnest, seek Selig’s.
Selig looks away.
He cannot abide the searching warmth of those eyes.
We started closing in a few weeks ago, Cushing continues.
So we waited.
We knew you’d show up again to deliver and solicit.
You’re out of business, Dave.
I should ask for a lawyer, Selig says.
I shouldn’t admit anything more to you.
No need to be so technical about your rights.
No, Cushing says.
What we really want to do is help you.
You’re sick, Dave.
And we’d admit you to the psychological counseling service here.
Cushing despises him.
Cushing suspects him of being homosexual.
Selig shrinks from Cushing’s disgust.
Am I so despicable, he wonders, am I such trash?
His hold on Cushing’s mind strengthens and deepens.
What does Cushing know?
Can Cushing penetrate the mind of another?
And there is ecstasy in it.
That stolid Cushing is the outer husk.
Selig has not been so happy in years.
Light, golden and serene, floods his soul.
An irresistible gaiety possesses him.
The birds awaken.
This is ecstasy!
This is contact!
Other minds surround his.
Yes, Selig replies.
Yes, I affirm the ecstasy of life.
I affirm the joy of contact.
I give myself to you.
They touch him.
He touches them.
For this moment of affirmation and fulfillment.
The invisible choir!
Oh, the joining, the touching, the union, the oneness!
No longer is he David Selig.
He breaks through.
He knows this ecstasy will last forever.
The choir’s glad note diminishes.
The sun drops toward the horizon.
The distant sea, retreating, sucks at the shore.
Hold back the tide?
Delay the fall of night?
The birdsongs are faint now.
The air has turned cold.
Everything rushes away from him.
It is very quiet, suddenly.
The plangent chord.
The breaking string.
The lyre untuned.
And nothing more.
Silence envelops him.
He can hear nothing.
He can feel nothing.
He is alone.
He is alone.
He is alone.
So quiet, he murmurs.
a deep voice asks.
What’s the matter with you, Selig?
I’m all right, Selig says.
He tries to stand, but nothing has any solidity.
The silence, Ted, the silence!
Strong arms seize him.
He is aware of several figures bustling about him.
Someone is calling for a doctor.
Except for the silence.
Winter is here.
Sky and pavement form a seamless, inexorable band of gray.
There will be snow soon.
Only concrete triumphs here.
Traffic is light.
There’s David Selig, they must be thinking.
How careless he was!
What a poor custodian of his gift!
I feel guilty for causing them this disappointment.
This is what I am, I tell myself.
This is what I now shall be.
If you don’t like it, tough crap.
Try to accept me.
If you can’t do that, just ignore me.
I wonder if he ever made it with anybody.
I can’t imagine Thoreau actually balling, can you?
Perhaps he didn’t even masturbate.
Silence is audible, Henry.
When we are half a block apart I recognize her.
Don’t you know me?
She studies me, frowns, seems puzzled for a moment.
But only a moment.
Her face looks more lean, the cheekbones higher and sharper.
There are some strands of gray in her hair.
Well, of course she’s in her middle thirties now.
Not exactly a girl.
She seems as beautiful as ever.
Yet desire is absent from me.
All passion spent, Selig.
All passion spent.
And she too is mysteriously free of turbulence.
Now her expression is amiable and casual.
We both have passed through the realm of storms.
You’re looking good, I say.
What is it, eight years, nine?
I know the answer to that.
I’m merely testing her.
And she passes the test, saying, The summer of ’68.
I’m relieved to see that she hasn’t forgotten.
I’m still a chapter of her autobiography, then.
How have you been, David?
The conversational inanities.
What are you doing these days?
I’m with Random House now.
Freelancing, I say.
Here and there.
Is she married?
Her gloved hands offer no data.
I don’t dare ask.
I’m incapable of probing.
The silence that has come between us suddenly seems unbridgeable.
Have we exhausted all feasible topics so soon?
She says, You’ve changed.
It isn’t that.
You’ve changed somewhere inside.
I suppose I have.
You used to make me feel uncomfortable.
I’d get a sort of queasy feeling.
I don’t any more.
You mean, after the trip?
Before and after both, she says.
You were always uncomfortable with me?
I never knew why.
And that’s gone now.
It’s entirely gone.
I wonder why.
Time heals all wounds, I say.
I suppose you’re right.
God, it’s cold!
Do you think it’ll snow?
It’s bound to, before long.
I hate the cold weather.
She huddles into her coat.
I never knew her in cold weather.
Spring and summer, then goodbye, get out, goodbye, goodbye.
Odd how little I feel for her now.
But also I’m not getting an aura from her.
She’s not broadcasting, or rather I’m not receiving.
She says, It’s been good to see you, David.
Let’s get together some time, shall we?
By all means.
We’ll have a drink and talk about old times.
I’d like that.
So would I.
Take care of yourself, David.
You too, Toni.
I give her a little mock-salute of farewell.
I feel a little warmer for having met her.
Everything cool, friendly, unemotional between us.
Everything dead, in fact.
All passion spent.
It’s been good to see you, David.
Let’s get together some time, shall we?
But she is out of sight.
As though she never was there at all.
And ever widening slowly silence all.
That’s Tennyson: Merlin and Vivien.
But you never knew it was Tennyson.
Neither did I.
My lute is riven.
Have you ever heard of Samuel Miller Hageman before?
You were a wise old cat, Sam, whoever you were.
One afternoon the daycamp staged some boxing matches.
I watched the first five matches in much dismay.
All that hitting!
All those bloody noses!
Then it was my turn.
called a counselor, and we approached each other.
That made him furious.
He gagged and turned away, half in tears.
End of round one.
I was sweating, bouncy, grinning.
Swinging wildly, frantically, still going for my head.
Hey, Joe Louis!
my father yelled.
Hey, Willie Pep!
That shattered him.
How they all hated me for my cleverness!
What they interpreted as my cleverness, that is.
Well, that wouldn’t be a problem now.
They’d all love me.
Loving me, they’d beat me to a pulp.
Judith answers the door.
I hear music from within: the Siegfried Idyll, I think.
Sweet, loving, accepting music.
Is it snowing yet?
Gray and cold, that’s all.
I’ll get you a drink.
Go into the livingroom.
I stand by the window.
A few snowflakes blow by.
To my amazement he smiles.
He says warmly, Hi, Uncle David!
Judith must have put him up to it.
Be nice to Uncle David, she must have said.
So there the kid stands, being nice to Uncle David.
I don’t think he’s ever smiled at me before.
Hi, Uncle David.
All right, kid.
I can dig it.
How have you been?
Fine, he says.
Music of tempestuous anguish followed by calmness and resignation.
The theme of acceptance again.
The swirling strings enfold me.
Rich, lush chords.
Judith appears, bringing me a glass of rum.
She has something mild for herself, sherry or vermouth.
She looks a little peaked but very friendly, very open.
Cheers, she says.
That’s good music you put on.
Of course, it’s very early Schoenberg.
Yes, I say.
What have you been up to lately, Jude?
A lot of the same old.
I don’t see Karl any more.
Didn’t I tell you that?
No, I say.
It’s the first I’ve heard of it.
I’m not accustomed to needing to tell you things, Duv.
You’d better get accustomed to it.
He became very insistent about marrying me.
He was hurt.
He’d be in his sixties and I’d still be young.
And I realized there was no future for us together.
I told him that as gently as I could.
He hasn’t called in ten days or so.
I suppose he won’t.
No need to be, Duv.
I did the smart thing.
I’m sure of it.
My Karl phase.
A very healthy phase.
Yes, I say.
Would you like some more rum?
In a little while.
What about you?
Tell me about yourself.
Now that my superman phase is over?
Yes, she says.
It’s really gone, eh?
And so, Duv?
How has it been for you since it happened?
You hear a lot about justice, God’s justice.
He looketh after the righteous.
He doeth dirt to the ungodly.
Where’s God, for that matter?
Look at His justice.
He sends a flood to Pakistan.
Maybe the supposedly innocent victims weren’t so innocent after all.
God laughs in our faces.
This is justice?
I mean, consider my case.
Listen, I didn’t ask to be a superman.
God’s incomprehensible whim.
It was a random twitch.
God said, Let this kid be a superman, and Lo!
For a time, anyhow.
Which He has now done.
The power’s gone.
Now that the power’s gone, who am I?
How do I define myself now?
The scars of it.
What am I supposed to do now?
I live on.
What a strange thing you did to me, God.
I’m not protesting, you understand.
I’m inquiring into the nature of divine justice.
For all guilt is revenged on earth.
That’s a reasonable complaint.
Is that fair?
I think I have a reasonable complaint too.
Where’s justice for the baby born without eyes?
The baby born with two heads?
Just asking, God.
I’m still entitled to ask.
Are you listening, God?
I don’t think you are.
I don’t think you give a crap.
God, I think you’ve been fucking me.
The music is ending.
Celestial harmonies filling the room.
Everything merging into oneness.
Snowflakes swirling beyond the windowpane.
Right on, Schoenberg.
You understood, at least when you were young.
You caught truth and put it on paper.
I hear what you’re saying, man.
Don’t ask questions, you say.
Only accept, that’s the motto.
Whatever comes to you, accept.
I can leave the baby with a friend in Connecticut.
But I won’t go if you need me, Duv.
Are you okay?
Can you manage?
Sure I can.
I’m not paralyzed, Jude.
I haven’t lost my sight.
Go to Switzerland, if that’s what you want.
I’ll only be gone eight days.
You ought to live down here close to me.
We should see more of each other.
I might even introduce you to some girlfriends of mine.
If you’re interested.
You don’t sound enthusiastic about it.
Go easy with me, I tell her.
Don’t rush me with a million things.
I need time to sort things out.
It’s like a new life, isn’t it, Duv?
A new life.
A new life, that’s what it is, Jude.
The storm is intense, now.
Cars are vanishing under the first layers of whiteness.
Well, why not?
Now of all times, why should I spurn her?
It’s really coming down, now.
The snow is so beautiful.
I can’t take my eyes from it.
My face is close to the window.
someone cries behind me.
Judith laughs too.
That’s the first time I’ve ever surprised you, she says.
In 31 years, the first time!
You gave me one hell of a jolt.
So I sneaked up and yelled in your ear.
You were really startled, Duv.
You weren’t faking at all.
No, of course not.
Then why’d you think I’d be faking?
I don’t know.
I guess I doubted you just a little.
I don’t any more.
Oh, Duv, Duv, I feel so sad for you!
Don’t, I say.
She is crying softly.
How strange that is, to watch Judith cry.
For love of me, no less.
For love of me.
It’s very quiet now.
The world is white outside and gray within.
I accept that.
I think life will be more peaceful.
Silence will become my mother tongue.
There will be discoveries and revelations, but no upheavals.
Living, we fret.
Dying, we live.
I’ll keep that in mind.
I’ll be of good cheer.
Until I die again, hello, hello, hello, hello.
The Salinas Valley is in Northern California.
I remember my childhood names for grasses and secret flowers.
The memory of odors is very rich.
They were beckoning mountains with a brown grass love.
The Salinas was only a part-time river.
The summer sun drove it underground.
You can boast about anything if it’s all you have.
And those things had happened right under our feet.
The spring flowers in a wet year were unbelievable.
And mixed with these were splashes of California poppies.
Cracks appeared on the level ground.
The Salinas River sank under its sand.
It stopped in the evening.
The water came in a thirty-year cycle.
The cows would grow thin and sometimes starve to death.
It was always that way.
And that was the long Salinas Valley.
They ate what they could pick up and planted nothing.
They pounded bitter acorns for flour.
Even their warfare was a weary pantomime.
They collected souls as they collected jewels.
We have San Miguel, St.
Wild Horse Canyon and Mustang Grade and Shirt Tail Canyon.
We always preferred to think it was the former.
Samuel had good looks and charm and gaiety.
He was a big man but delicate in a way.
In the dusty business of ranching he seemed always immaculate.
His hands were clever.
He followed the usual practice.
But the acres were harsh and dry.
Samuel had no gift for reminding them.
And so the Hamiltons stayed poor.
The children came along as regularly as the years.
And he was equally good with mare, cow, or woman.
Gunn’s Family Medicine.
To look through Dr.
Gunn is to know the Hamiltons’ medical history.
Samuel kept always a foreignness.
Liza Hamilton was a very different kettle of Irish.
Liza had a finely developed sense of sin.
His wife protected him whenever she could.
She frightened her grandchildren because she had no weakness.
She felt that rewards came later.
And all proportions changed.
They and the coyotes lived clever, despairing, submarginal lives.
Surely such venture is nearly gone from the world.
And the families did survive and grow.
Such a man was Adam Trask.
He came home six weeks after Adam was born.
His right leg was off at the knee.
And already it was splitting.
The toothmarks in the bullet proved that.
But Cyrus had vitality and swagger.
Trask was a pale, inside-herself woman.
Her new god was an expert in punishment.
He demanded of her a sacrifice.
This required great will power.
And it did.
Cyrus soon solved the problem.
The baby was drunk for two days and a half.
The courtship was quick and realistic.
There was no doubt in anybody’s mind about his intentions.
They were honorable and reasonable.
Her father abetted the courtship.
This was her first proposal.
Cyrus wanted a woman to take care of Adam.
His neighbors did not find his action hasty.
Alice Trask had a number of admirable qualities.
Whether she liked children or not no one ever knew.
He never once promoted himself to noncommissioned rank.
Private Trask he began, and Private Trask he remained.
No one could call him a liar.
Indeed, Cyrus developed an excellent military mind.
His articles in various magazines attracted attention.
And such a voice in military matters Cyrus Trask became.
His expertness was apparent to everyone who heard him.
He had a genius for the military.
as a cohesive and potent force in the national life.
So much for his public life.
He was a man devoted.
His house and farm he organized on a military basis.
It is probable that Alice preferred it this way.
She was not a talker.
A terse report was easiest for her.
In the night she would be drenched with perspiration.
And she did not know how long she would live.
Some people wasted on for quite a few years.
There wasn’t any rule about it.
Perhaps she didn’t dare to mention it to her husband.
She became a rear rank private.
It was much easier that way.
It was the little boys who really caught it.
The gods are fallen and all safety gone.
And the child’s world is never quite whole again.
It is an aching kind of growing.
Adam found his father out.
god comes crashing down in a child’s brain.
Young Adam was always an obedient child.
Even praise and reprimand he would not delegate.
Alice never complained, quarreled, laughed, or cried.
Alice did not see him.
She was darning socks and she was smiling.
He settled deep between the protecting roots.
He breathed excitedly, high against his throat.
For Alice had been naked—she had been smiling.
He wondered how she had dared such wantonness.
She asked no questions and made no comment.
He spoke of it often.
Charles was pretty near a man already.
Adam was not good at games.
Four times he drove the peewee farther than Charles did.
The hatred in Charles’ face frightened him.
I guess it was just an accident, he said lamely.
I bet I couldn’t do it again.
Charles moved slowly toward Adam, his eyes cold and noncommittal.
Adam edged away in terror.
After a while Adam became conscious.
He breathed shallowly because his chest hurt.
He could hear his stepmother coughing in her room.
Charles had one great quality.
He was never sorry—ever.
Charles was not sorry.
He had very simply fulfilled himself.
His speech became softer toward him.
He did not punish him any more.
Almost nightly he lectured him, but not violently.
Cyrus explained softly to Adam the nature of a soldier.
I’ll try to tell you.
We put no checks on him.
Why do they have to do it?
Why is it?
I don’t know, he said.
You’ll go in soon now—you’ve come to the age.
I don’t want to, said Adam quickly.
You’ll go in soon, his father went on, not hearing.
I don’t want to do it, said Adam.
You’ll know no word the others can’t say.
And you’ll do things because the others do them.
What if I don’t?
Yes, said Cyrus, sometimes that happens.
It’s better to fall in with them.
They only do it to protect themselves.
But these had not much face to start with.
And maybe you’re like that.
Suddenly Adam said, You see that stump there, sir?
Let’s go and see the place, his father said.
I knew about it long ago, he said.
Adam was staring at his father in wonder.
You never came here looking for me, he said.
No, Cyrus replied.
I wouldn’t do that.
You can drive a human too far.
I wouldn’t do that.
Always you must leave a man one escape before death.
I knew, I guess, how hard I was pressing you.
I didn’t want to push you over the edge.
They moved restlessly off through the trees.
Cyrus said, So many things I want to tell you.
I’ll forget most of them.
He starts with that great instinct, and everything confirms it.
This is the great reward.
Maybe this is the only reward.
Maybe this is the final purity all ringed with filth.
It’s nearly dark.
But Adam said, Why don’t you talk to my brother?
Charles will be going.
He’ll be good at it, much better than I am.
Charles won’t be going, Cyrus said.
There’d be no point in it.
But he would be a better soldier.
Only outside on his skin, said Cyrus.
I would not dare to let him go.
His father did not reply.
Where are you?
Here—right behind you—right here.
You asked a question.
I guess I’ll have to answer.
Maybe it’s good and maybe it’s bad to answer it.
You’re not clever.
You don’t know what you want.
You have no proper fierceness.
You let other people walk over you.
Does that answer your question?
I love you better.
I always have.
I love you better.
Now shut your mouth and go to your supper.
I’ll talk to you tomorrow night.
My leg aches.
There was no talk at supper.
Adam thought his brother watched him secretly.
After he had finished eating Adam pushed back his chair.
I think I’ll go for a walk, he said.
Charles stood up.
I’ll go with you.
She asked nervously, What did you do?
Nothing, he said.
Will you make him go?
Does he know?
Cyrus stared bleakly out the open door into the darkness.
Yes, he knows.
He won’t like it.
It’s not right for him.
This is not your affair.
Alice did not reply.
The boys walked down the dark rutty road.
I hadn’t thought of it, said Adam.
You didn’t have to come, said Adam.
Charles moved close to him.
What did he say to you this afternoon?
I saw you walking together.
What did he say?
He just talked about the army—like always.
Didn’t look like that to me, Charles said suspiciously.
What did he tell you?
Charles demanded again.
I don’t believe you, said Charles.
I think you’re a goddam mealy-mouthed liar.
What’re you trying to get away with?
Nothing, said Adam.
Charles said harshly, Your crazy mother drowned herself.
Maybe she took a look at you.
That’d do it.
He was silent.
Charles cried, You’re trying to take him away!
I don’t know how you’re going about it.
What do you think you’re doing?
Nothing, said Adam.
Look at his birthday!
Where’s that knife?
Do you ever see him use it?
Did he give it to you?
I never even saw him hone it.
Have you got that knife in your pocket?
What did he do with it?
Thanks,’ he said, like that.
Adam swallowed saliva to dampen his dry throat.
What did you do on his birthday?
You think I didn’t see?
Did you spend six bits or even four bits?
That dog sleeps in his room.
He plays with it while he’s reading.
He’s got it all trained.
And where’s the knife?
Thanks,’ he said, just Thanks.
 Charles spoke in a whisper, and his shoulders dropped.
His brother moved precisely, each foot planted firmly.
Adam felt the bone and gristle of his nose crunch.
Time was slowed to him.
His arms let go.
Adam felt the punches on temples, cheeks, eyes.
The punching continued eternally.
Charles stood over him, gulping air like a run-out dog.
Consciousness came back quick and frightening to Adam.
His mind rolled in a painful mist.
His body was heavy and thick with hurt.
But almost instantly he forgot his hurts.
He heard quick footsteps on the road.
He searched the road for signs.
At last he gave it up.
For a long time Adam lay in the cool water.
These things Adam felt for him.
Adam crept out of the water and stood up.
He shuffled slowly up the road with wide-spread legs.
At the stoop he paused, looked in.
Alice, glancing up, saw Adam’s bloody face.
Then Cyrus raised his head.
He looked with a distant curiosity.
The identity of the distortion came to him slowly.
He stood up, puzzled and wondering.
Why did he do it?
Cyrus asked softly.
He licked his lips and started them bleeding again.
I don’t know, he said.
Don’t lie to me!
Why did he do it?
Did you have an argument?
Cyrus wrenched at him.
I want to know.
You’ll have to tell me.
I’ll make you tell me!
Goddam it, you’re always protecting him!
Don’t you think I know that?
Did you think you were fooling me?
Adam cast about for an answer.
He doesn’t think you love him.
Alice, he said, help Adam to bed.
You’ll have to cut his shirt off, I guess.
Give him a hand.
And her rope broke and her face hid her thoughts.
Go in your room, she said.
I’ll bring some water in a basin.
But you love him—you always have.
Adam did not answer her.
She went on quietly, He’s a strange boy.
You have to know him, she repeated.
But he doesn’t give them right out.
He hides them where he knows I’ll find them.
You have to know him.
She smiled at Adam and he closed his eyes.
He stood and grinned and rubbed his split knuckles.
In the dooryard their horses were held by two privates.
And his father’s eyes glistened with tears.
Barrack life is not a good life for long.
But the cavalry has work to do.
I made sure of that.
You’ll like going for the Indian country.
There’s action coming.
I can’t tell you how I know.
There’s fighting on the way.
Yes, sir, Adam said.
The rain came wrong and damned the apple blossoms.
It does not look the same.
Something settles down on it.
I don’t know what, but it will not scrub off.
But I have spread the dirt around more evenly anyways.
Did Father write you anything about his trip?
But this is not any great shucks to Father.
I would like to see the White House.
I think I better look around for a wife.
What do you think?
I hope so.
I miss you.
The writing stopped there.
In pencil it said, Later.
Well, right there the pen gave out.
One of the points broke off.
The words began to flow more smoothly.
Old Black Joe started crowing out in the henhouse.
It kind of makes my skin crawl.
Why didn’t he?
I had to take out after you.
It’s just the light.
I don’t take any truck with that.
Seems like to me there’s something not finished.
Something didn’t get done.
I shouldn’t be here.
It’s me should be where you are and you here.
I never thought like this before.
Maybe because it’s late—it’s later than that.
I just looked out and it’s first dawn.
I don’t think I fell off to sleep.
How could the night go so fast?
I can’t go to bed now.
I couldn’t sleep anyways.
The letter was not signed.
Behind George, Will grew along, dumpy and stolid.
Will had little imagination but he had great energy.
He was in fact a foreigner and an Irishman.
At that time the Irish were much disliked in America.
In that day an educated rich man was acceptable.
Take Samuel, for instance.
That was good and understandable, even enviable.
And these caused men to laugh with embarrassed uneasiness.
Will might have picked up his conservatism right then.
Things come to them without their effort or planning.
Will Hamilton was one of these.
As a growing boy Will was lucky.
He was not niggardly.
He gave them what they asked for.
Tom, the third son, was most like his father.
He was born in fury and he lived in lightning.
Tom came headlong into life.
He was a giant in joy and enthusiasms.
When he read his father’s books, he was the first.
He would try things his father would not dare.
It was a very moral family he was born into.
Tom was a nice mixture of savagery and gentleness.
I can fix that, he said.
And then he ran away and was sick.
The Hamilton house grew as the family grew.
Meanwhile Samuel got no richer.
Some men think big and some think little.
His brothers were tough hard workers, all of them.
Joe was physically lazy, and probably mentally lazy too.
Joe was the darling of the family.
Gradually he eliminated himself from every farm duty.
She early seemed to find a shame for her family.
The next sister was Olive, my mother.
It is amazing how Liza stamped her children.
She could hold up her head anywhere.
Her husband and her children and her grandchildren respected her.
Liza hated alcoholic liquors with an iron zeal.
She set her little hard chin.
You would not!
And they were American children and young men and women.
He was a busy man.
He had no time for nostalgia.
The Salinas Valley was the world.
His energy was large.
He was proud of her wild, exploring mind.
Will was well along the way to accidental fortune.
Tom bruised himself on the world and licked his cuts.
There was no question of inheritance.
Although the hill ranch was large it was abysmally poor.
That would have made the difference.
Water would have made them comparatively rich.
Samuel was well pleased with the fruit of his loins.
The arrangement was simple and reasonably secret.
Hallam, the innkeeper, had no part in the arrangement.
It was an extremely workable system.
No drunken man was permitted to go up to them.
The two-week stands had another advantage.
Hallam knew nothing about it, and Mr.
Edwards never appeared publicly in his business capacity.
He had a very good thing in his circuit.
A man could hardly tell there had been a change.
Charles rarely did more than sweep.
Charles developed a restlessness that got him out at dawn.
He worked the farm mightily because he was lonely.
One large boulder was difficult to move.
Suddenly he lost his temper.
In that day pus was.
The wound had not worried Charles, but the scar did.
It looked like a long fingermark laid on his forehead.
The damn thing gets darker.
I don’t know why it bothers me.
I got plenty other scars.
It just seems like I was marked.
I don’t know why they’re so damn curious about it.
In appearance he had changed little.
There was no military carriage about him.
The cavalry didn’t act that way.
Indeed some units took pride in a sloppy posture.
Adam felt that he was sleepwalking.
Home was not a pleasant place in his mind.
He watched the falls by the hour.
Their roar stupefied and hypnotized him.
He did not see or hear.
He simply absorbed the contact.
I’ll have one more, Adam said.
The bartender set the bottle out.
Adam noticed him for the first time.
He had a strawberry mark on his forehead.
I’m a stranger in these parts, said Adam.
I’ve been in the army.
the bartender said.
Fighting Indians, he said.
Had some great times.
The man did not answer him.
My brother has a mark on his head.
The bartender touched the strawberry mark with his fingers.
Birthmark, he said.
Gets bigger every year.
Your brother got one?
His came from a cut.
He wrote me about it.
You notice this one of mine looks like a cat?
Sure it does.
That’s my nickname, Cat.
Had it all my life.
I’m on my way home.
Been away a long time.
Won’t you have a drink?
Where you staying?
May’s boarding house.
I know her.
I guess there are tricks to every trade, said Adam.
I guess that’s right.
There’s sure plenty in mine.
I bet that’s true, said Adam.
But the one trick I need I haven’t got.
I wisht I knew that one.
What is it?
It’s a joke, the bartender said uneasily.
I guess I’ll go home in the morning, said Adam.
I mean my real home.
Good luck, the bartender said.
Good night, said Adam.
She did not answer him.
At the top of the first flight he looked back.
His room smelled of dust dampened and dried many times.
And Adam knew he could not go home.
I just couldn’t stand it.
Didn’t have no place to go.
Didn’t know nobody.
His father found him there.
Cyrus had become a great man.
And Cyrus conducted himself like a great man.
Suddenly he looked down—no wooden leg.
Cyrus saw the look.
Mechanical, he said, Works on a hinge.
Got a spring.
Don’t even limp when I set my mind to it.
I’ll show it to you when I take it off.
Come along with me.
Adam said, I’m under orders, sir.
I’m to report to Colonel Wells.
I know you are.
I told Wells to issue the orders.
His father reversed himself.
I was testing you, he said grandly.
I knew it would be good for you.
You’re a man and a soldier, my boy.
I’m under orders, sir, said Adam.
This man was a stranger to him.
A faint distaste arose in Adam.
Something was not true.
This is my son, a private soldier, Mr.
I was discharged a corporal, sir, said Adam.
He hardly heard the exchange of compliments.
He was thinking, This is the Secretary of War.
What’s happened to him?
It’s funny the Secretary can’t see it.
I live in a hotel, he said.
I’m all over the country most of the time.
The hotel clerk couldn’t see either.
Send a bottle of whisky to my room, please.
I can send some chipped ice if you like.
My son is a soldier.
I have been a soldier—a private soldier.
What do we want ice for?
Adam was amazed at Cyrus’s accommodations.
Cyrus sat down in a deep chair and sighed.
It gets to pinching pretty bad, he said.
He faced Adam.
Why did you re-enlist?
I—I don’t know, sir.
I just wanted to.
You don’t like the army, Adam.
Why did you go back?
I didn’t want to go home.
Are you going to stay in the army?
I don’t know, sir.
I can get you into West Point.
I have influence.
I don’t want to go there.
Are you defying me?
Cyrus asked quietly.
I can make men and I can destroy men.
Do you know that?
Adam knew more than that.
He knew that Cyrus was defending himself with threats.
I’d rather go back to my regiment, sir.
He saw the shadow of loss darken his father’s face.
Maybe I made a mistake.
You’ve learned the dumb resistance of a soldier.
I’ll get you ordered to your regiment.
You’ll rot in barracks.
Thank you, sir.
Adam remembered his father’s tone and how he looked.
He remembered that Cyrus was lonely and alone—and knew it.
Charles had looked forward to Adam’s return after five years.
She was a clean, mean old woman.
Pigs is clean compared.
Rot in their own juice.
Don’t see how no woman ever marries them.
Stink like measles.
Look at oven—pie juice from Methuselah.
He wanted to keep the house clean for Adam.
The bellows forced quick flaring heat from the coke.
He wondered why he had never thought of it before.
Charles waited for Adam, and Adam did not come.
Perhaps Adam was ashamed to write.
It was like somebody else doing it.
Write soon and tell me how you are.
Time had got in its work.
Charles began to keep one slovenly woman after another.
He grew away from the village.
His contacts were only with the inn and the postmaster.
The farm had never been so well run.
For these things he kept the respect of his neighbors.
It should be so, but it is not.
And this is right when you think about it.
Eventlessness has no posts to drape duration on.
From nothing to nothing is no time at all.
Adam’s second five years were up before he knew it.
He learned to beg, not for money but for food.
And before he knew it he was a bindlestiff himself.
They worked a little, but not for long.
They followed warmth and avoided great heat and great cold.
Adam heard of the development of the I.
with its angry angels.
Adam took pleasure in the new life.
And he lay in the sun-warmed sand, counting the waves.
Spring urged him east again, but more slowly than before.
and aggravated by the fierce reprisals against them.
Adam was picked up for vagrancy.
When spring came again he started north.
He felt that he had to move quickly.
That’s how the roads were built.
His sentence was six months.
He drew a curtain around himself.
And Adam learned this.
Adam waited until three days before his second release.
He did not get out of the water.
He had schooled himself against hurry.
Most men were caught bolting.
He was astonished at his ability.
Then he replaced the lock but left the window open.
He had to work by moonlight drifting through dirty windows.
He had taken nothing which was not heavily stocked.
He had not even looked for the cash drawer.
The rain started late in the afternoon.
It was twenty minutes before the friend went away.
Adam watched him off the platform.
Charles received very few letters.
Charles let him wait.
Then he folded it up and turned toward the house.
The postmaster called after him, Anything wrong, Mr.
Took it hard, the postmaster reported in town.
Took it real hard.
Don’t talk much.
There hadn’t been anyone to send him a telegram.
The attorneys had found his address among his father’s papers.
They were sorry—offered their condolences.
And they were pretty excited too.
That is what he looked to be worth.
They felt very different about Mr.
People with that much money were rich.
They would never have to worry.
It was enough to start a dynasty.
The lawyers congratulated Charles and his brother Adam.
He wondered about Adam.
He wanted Adam home.
Charles felt puzzled and dull.
Then he went back to stare at the letter.
Listen to this, he said to the operator.
I already read it.
It comes over the wire, said the operator.
I wrote it down.
Urgent need you telegraph me one hundred dollars.
Came collect, the operator said.
You owe me sixty cents.
Valdosta, Georgia—I never heard of it.
Neither’d I, but it’s there.
Say, Carlton, how do you go about telegraphing money?
You owe me sixty cents too.
I’ll pay—say, how do I know it’s Adam?
What’s to stop anybody from collecting it?
The operator permitted himself a smile of worldliness.
So I send both the question and the answer.
Say, that’s pretty cute.
I better think up a good one.
Charles was delighted with the game.
He came back with the money in his hand.
I got the question, he said.
I hope it ain’t your mother’s middle name.
Lot of people don’t remember.
No, nothing like that.
It’s a good question but it’s long as hell.
Can’t you cut it down to ten words?
Who’s paying for it?
Answer is, A pup.
Wouldn’t nobody guess that, said Carlton.
Well, it’s you paying, not me.
Be funny if he forgot, said Charles.
He wouldn’t ever get home.
Adam came walking out from the village.
The hammering stopped, and there was silence.
How are you?
Fine, said Adam.
Good God, you’re thin!
I guess I am.
And I’m years older too.
Charles inspected him from head to foot.
You don’t look prosperous.
Where’s your valise?
I haven’t got one.
Where’ve you been?
Mostly wandering around all over.
Like a hobo?
Like a hobo.
Why didn’t you come home?
I just got to wandering.
It gets into you.
That’s a real bad scar you’ve got there.
That’s the one I wrote you about.
Gets worse all the time.
Why didn’t you write?
Are you hungry?
It may go away.
It was a birthmark.
His nickname was Cat.
Are you hungry?
Sure, I guess I am.
Plan to stay home now?
I—I guess so.
Do you want to get to it now?
I—I guess so, Charles echoed him.
Our father is dead.
How the hell do you know?
Station agent told me.
How long ago did he die?
 ’Bout a month.
I got a letter and newspapers.
Carried him on a caisson with a flag over it.
The Vice-President was there and the President sent a wreath.
All in the papers.
Pictures too—I’ll show you.
I’ve got it all.
Adam studied his brother’s face until Charles looked away.
Are you mad at something?
What should I be mad at?
I’ve got nothing to be mad at.
Come on, I’ll get you something to eat.
Did he linger long?
It was galloping pneumonia.
Went right out.
Charles was covering up something.
He kept hiding in words.
Adam fell silent.
Still, how can you know?
Some people claim they’ve had messages—old Sarah Whitburn.
You just don’t know what to think.
You didn’t get a message, did you?
Say, what the hell’s bit off your tongue?
Adam said, Just thinking.
Wonder why not?
Could it be the army?
Or the chain gang?
Could it be Father’s death?
Maybe—but I don’t understand it.
They walked into the kitchen he remembered and didn’t remember.
It seemed smaller and dingier.
Adam said almost gaily, Charles, I been listening.
You better tell before it bites you.
Charles’ eyes sparked up with anger.
He raised his head.
His force was gone.
He thought with desolation, I can’t lick him any more.
I never felt as good.
Spill it, Charles.
Don’t let it chew on you.
Charles asked, Did you love our father?
Did you or didn’t you?
What’s that got to do with you?
All right, I’ll tell you.
Sometimes he scared me.
Now tell me why you want to know.
Charles was looking down at his hands.
I don’t understand, he said.
I just can’t get it through my head.
He loved you more than anything in the world.
I don’t believe that.
You don’t have to.
He liked everything you brought him.
He didn’t like me.
He didn’t like anything I gave him.
Remember the present I gave him, the pocketknife?
Well, he didn’t even take it to Washington with him.
It’s right in his bureau right now.
And you gave him a pup.
It didn’t cost you a thing.
Well, I’ll show you a picture of that pup.
It was at his funeral.
A colonel was holding it—it was blind, couldn’t walk.
They shot it after the funeral.
Adam was puzzled at the fierceness of his brother’s tone.
I don’t see, he said.
I don’t see what you’re getting at.
I loved him, said Charles.
He put his head down in his arms and cried.
The house was not pretty either.
It was a well-built shanty for shelter and cooking.
His brother’s sobbing had stopped.
Charles was looking blankly straight ahead.
Adam said, Tell me about Mother.
I wrote you.
Tell me about her.
I told you.
It’s so long ago.
She wasn’t your mother.
Her face was projected in front of him.
Charles’ voice came through the image and exploded it.
Charles moved his lips to form the question in advance.
What do you mean?
Isn’t that plain enough?
I said it plain.
There’s only one meaning to dishonest.
I don’t know, said Adam.
I don’t know.
No one ever said it.
Look what he got to be.
Stayed overnight in the White House.
The Vice-President came to his funeral.
Does that sound like a dishonest man?
Charles wet his lips.
His voice became a monotone.
Father made a will.
Left everything equal to me and you.
Well, we can always live on the farm.
I guess we won’t starve.
More like a hundred dollars.
Where would he get it?
It’s no mistake.
His salary with the G.
was a hundred and thirty-five dollars a month.
He paid his own room and board.
No, he didn’t have it all the time.
Well, why don’t we write to the G.
Someone there might know.
I wouldn’t dare, said Charles.
Don’t go off half-cocked.
There’s such a thing as speculation.
Lots of men struck it rich.
He knew big men.
Maybe he got in on a good thing.
Charles’ face was desolate.
It was as toneless as a report.
Our father went into the Union Army in June 1862.
He had three months’ training here in this state.
That makes it September.
He marched south.
He came home in January.
I don’t see what you’re getting at.
Charles’ words were thin and sallow.
He was not at Chancellorsville.
How do you know?
It came down with his other papers.
Adam sighed deeply.
He shook his head almost in disbelief.
Charles said, How did he get away with it?
How in hell did he get away with it?
Nobody ever questioned it.
Did my mother?
Not even in Washington.
Adam stood up.
What’s in the house to eat?
I’m going to warm up something.
I killed a chicken last night.
I’ll fry it if you can wait.
Some salt pork and plenty of eggs.
I’ll have that, said Adam.
Their words ignored it but their minds never left it.
They wanted to talk about it and could not.
I plowed the pasture, he said.
Put it in rye.
How did it do?
Just fine, once I got the rocks out.
He touched his forehead.
You wrote about that, Adam said.
You never wrote much what you were doing, said Charles.
I guess I didn’t want to think about it.
It was pretty bad, most of it.
I read about the campaigns in the papers.
Did you go on those?
I didn’t want to think about them.
Did you kill Injuns?
Yes, we killed Injuns.
I guess they’re real ornery.
I guess so.
I don’t want to.
They ate their dinner under the kerosene lamp.
I’ll do it, said Adam.
It’s hard to think of everything.
It’s going to be fine having you back.
Well, we’ll see.
Maybe I’d like just to sit awhile.
They change every two weeks.
I didn’t know but you’d like to look them over.
Yes, they’re upstairs.
Makes it pretty handy.
How much do they charge?
Pretty nice girls mostly.
Maybe later, said Adam.
I’m surprised they let them come in.
I was too at first.
But they worked out a system.
You go often?
Every two or three weeks.
It’s pretty lonesome here, a man living alone.
You wrote once you were thinking of getting married.
Well, I was.
Guess I didn’t find the right girl.
All around the main subject the brothers beat.
Once he said openly, Let’s sleep on that other thing.
Sure, if you want to, said Charles.
Gradually they ran out of escape talk.
Every acquaintance was covered and every local event.
The talk lagged and the time went on.
Feel like turning in?
In a little while.
I sure would like to’ve seen that funeral, said Charles.
Must have been pretty fancy.
Would you care to see the clippings from the papers?
I’ve got them all in my room.
We’ll have to figure it out, he said nervously.
I know that, said Adam.
Would that do any good?
You think time is going to help?
I guess not.
I guess not.
What do you want to talk about first?
I guess we might as well get into it.
We’re not thinking about anything else.
There’s the money, said Charles.
Over a hundred thousand dollars—a fortune.
What about the money?
Well, where did it come from?
How do I know?
I told you he might have speculated.
Do you believe that?
I don’t believe anything, Adam said.
I don’t know, so what can I believe?
It’s a lot of money, said Charles.
It’s a fortune left to us.
Maybe you didn’t think about it, but we’re rich.
We’re richer than anybody hereabouts.
You say it like it was a jail sentence.
Where did it come from?
What do you care?
Maybe we should just settle back and enjoy it.
He wasn’t at Gettysburg.
He wasn’t at any goddam battle in the whole war.
He was hit in a skirmish.
Everything he told was lies.
What are you getting at?
I think he stole the money, Charles said miserably.
You asked me and that’s what I think.
Do you know where he stole it?
Then why do you think he stole it?
He told lies about the war.
He held jobs in the G.
Have them go over the books.
If it’s true we could give back the money.
The Vice-President came to his funeral.
The President sent a wreath.
And do you know who the pall bearers were?
What are you digging at?
 ’Spose we found out he’s a thief.
Adam sat very still.
His eyes were untroubled but he was watchful.
I thought you loved him, he said calmly.
He felt released and free.
That’s why I hate this—his whole life gone—all gone.
His words were ragged with emotion.
Didn’t you love him at all?
I wasn’t sure until now, said Adam.
I did not love him.
Adam’s brain raced, trying to find words for his feeling.
I don’t have to care.
No, you don’t, Charles said bitterly.
Not if you didn’t love him, you don’t.
You can help kick him in the face.
Adam knew that his brother was no longer dangerous.
There was no jealousy to drive him.
How will you feel, walking in town, after everyone knows?
How will you face anybody?
I told you I don’t care.
I don’t have to care because I don’t believe it.
You don’t believe what?
I don’t believe he stole any money.
But the proof—how about the discharge?
You haven’t any proof that he stole.
They could be wrong, Adam said.
I believe they are wrong.
I believe in my father.
I don’t see how you can.
Adam said, Let me tell you.
But you said you did not love our father.
Maybe that’s the reason, Adam said slowly, feeling his way.
Maybe—maybe love makes you suspicious and doubting.
I can see it pretty clearly.
I did not love him.
Maybe he loved me.
Maybe—why, maybe it’s a kind of reverse.
Charles stared at him.
I don’t understand, he said.
I’m trying to, said Adam.
It’s a new thought to me.
I feel good.
I’ve got rid of something.
I don’t understand, Charles said again.
I don’t believe he was a liar.
I won’t look at the papers.
Charles was breathing heavily.
Then you would take the money?
Even if he stole it?
He did not steal it.
He couldn’t have stolen it.
I don’t understand, said Charles.
Do you remember later?
You came back with a hatchet to kill me.
I don’t remember very well.
I must have been crazy.
Yes, said Adam.
We’ll use the money well.
Maybe we’ll stay here.
Maybe we’ll go away—maybe to California.
We’ll have to see what we’ll do.
I couldn’t ever go away from here, said Charles.
Well, let’s see how it goes, There’s no hurry.
We’ll feel it out.
Once they were considered the visible punishment for concealed sins.
Having never had arms, he cannot miss them.
To a criminal, honesty is foolish.
Some balance wheel was misweighted, some gear out of ratio.
She was not like other people, never was from birth.
They were thin flaps sealed against her head.
Her breasts never developed very much.
Before her puberty the nipples turned inward.
Most children abhor difference.
It is a protective coloration children utilize for their safety.
Cathy had none of this.
She never conformed in dress or conduct.
She wore whatever she wanted to.
The result was that quite often other children imitated her.
That is just ordinary deviation from external reality.
A story has in it neither gain nor loss.
But a lie is a device for profit or escape.
Cathy’s lies were never innocent.
She thought all children were like her own.
Cathy’s father was not so sure.
It was a matter more felt than known.
It was at once a weapon and a threat.
It was irresistible.
One would be a monster.
She planned everything coldly, foreseeing difficulties and preparing for them.
The sex play of children has always gone on.
In the time of Cathy’s childhood, however, it was harder.
Ames remembered having seen Cathy stroll away toward the barn.
There was no answer.
An uneasiness came over her.
It had not been Cathy’s voice.
Cathy was not a giggler.
Ames stood still, listening.
The double doors were closed.
She froze, mouth open, at what she saw.
Cathy lay on the floor, her skirts pulled up.
The shock of the sudden light froze them too.
Cathy’s eyes were blank with terror.
Ames knew the boys, knew their parents.
Suddenly one of the boys leaped up, darted past Mrs.
Ames, and ran around the corner of the house.
She could hear his running-footsteps outside.
Cathy stared blankly up at her and made no move.
Cathy did not speak for a long time.
Shock, the doctor called it.
Ames was silent most of the time.
He carried the rope which had been around Cathy’s wrists.
His eyes were puzzled.
Ames settled down to a steady hysteria.
She had been there.
She had seen.
She was the final authority.
And out of her hysteria a sadistic devil peered.
She wanted blood.
The town, the country, must be protected.
She put it on that basis.
She had arrived in time, thank God.
And Cathy was only ten years old.
Punishments were more savage then than they are now.
And their defense was from the beginning ridiculous.
They had not tied her hands.
Ames said it first and the whole town echoed it.
Do they mean to say she tied her own hands?
A ten-year-old child?
She’s haunted by it, Mrs.
Ames told the neighbors.
The Ameses never spoke of it to her again.
The subject was closed.
Ames very soon forgot his haunting reservations.
William Ames, Cathy’s father, was a covered man.
He rarely told the thoughts in his mind.
He kept the little flame of suspicion to himself.
Cathy grew more lovely all the time.
Parents took honor from a daughter who was a teacher.
Cathy was fourteen when she entered high school.
They had lost her.
They felt that she was translated to a higher order.
James Grew became a man.
He walked on his toes and sang to himself.
And then the flame went out.
His shoulders, held so high and square, folded dejectedly.
His eyes grew feverish and his hands twitched.
I’ve got to see you, he said hoarsely to Mr.
It’s after midnight, Mr.
Ames said sternly.
I’ve got to see you alone.
Put on some clothes and come outside.
I’ve got to talk to you.
Young man, I think you’re drunk or sick.
Go home and get some sleep.
It’s after midnight.
I can’t wait.
I’ve got to talk to you.
Come down to the tannery in the morning, said Mr.
He heard the wailing voice, I can’t wait.
What in the world?
his wife demanded when he came back to the bedside.
A drunken man, he said.
Got the wrong house.
He didn’t go back to sleep for a long time.
The whole top of his head was blown off.
One of the three candles was still burning.
The other two had not been lighted.
James Grew left no letter.
No one could figure why he had done it.
Then he thought, What good would it do?
If I knew anything it would be different.
But I don’t know a single thing.
He had a sick feeling in his stomach.
How could I have helped it?
I don’t even know what he wanted.
He felt guilty and miserable.
Cathy sat silent, but no more silent than usual.
There’s one thing I meant to speak of, she said.
No, he said quickly.
Are you sure?
Could you see him in the dark?
I had a candle, he said sharply.
Didn’t look anything like, had a big beard.
No need to snap at me, she said.
I just wondered.
Ames turned to her daughter.
You saw him every day in school, Cathy.
Has he seemed sad lately?
Cathy looked down at her plate and then up.
I thought he was sick, she said.
Yes, he has looked bad.
Everybody was talking in school today.
And somebody—I don’t remember who—said that Mr.
Grew was in some kind of trouble in Boston.
I didn’t hear what kind of trouble.
We all liked Mr.
She wiped her lips delicately.
That was Cathy’s method.
Ames had forgotten where she heard it.
Soon after her sixteenth birthday a change came over Cathy.
One morning she did not get up for school.
Hurry, you’ll be late.
It’s nearly nine.
I’m not going.
There was no emphasis in her voice.
Are you sick?
Then hurry, get up.
I’m not going.
You must be sick.
You’ve never missed a day.
I’m not going to school, Cathy said calmly.
I’m never going to school again.
Her mother’s mouth fell open.
What do you mean?
What’s that book you’re hiding?
Here, I’m not hiding it.
Alice in Wonderland.
You’re too big for that.
What in the world are you talking about?
Nobody can find me.
Her mother said angrily, Stop making jokes.
I don’t know what you’re thinking of.
What does Miss Fancy think she is going to do?
I don’t know yet, said Cathy.
I think I’ll go away.
Her eyes were expressionless and cold.
And suddenly Mrs.
Ames was afraid of her daughter.
She went out quietly and closed the door.
Her daughter had become a stranger to her.
She had been used for Cathy’s purposes always.
After a while Mrs.
Ames put on a bonnet and went to the tannery.
That evening Mr.
This made him angry and he fell into threats.
He had her attention now.
She looked him right in the eyes.
He ordered her to stop her nonsense.
He ended on a note of weakness.
Her face was expressionless.
The little mouth was straight.
All right, she said.
Later that night Mr.
Maybe we’ve been too lax.
But she has been a good child.
I guess she just forgot who’s boss.
A little sternness never hurt anybody.
He wished he were as confident as his words.
In the morning she was gone.
Her bed was neatly made.
Cathy had never played with dolls.
The room had no Cathy imprint.
In his way Mr.
Ames was an intelligent man.
The station agent was certain.
Cathy had taken the early morning train.
She had bought a ticket for Boston.
He helped Mr.
Ames write a telegram to the Boston police.
He was a very good man in a crisis.
That night Mrs.
Ames sat in the kitchen with the door closed.
The whip licked and cut.
Cathy learned quickly.
Cathy dropped back on the bed, sobbing.
He said, Now, will you ever do that again?
No, oh, no!
Forgive me, Cathy said.
See you remember who you are.
And don’t forget what I am.
Cathy’s voice caught.
She produced a dry sob.
I won’t forget, she said.
In the kitchen Mrs.
Ames wrestled her hands.
Her husband put his fingers on her shoulder.
I hated to do it, he said.
I had to.
And I think it did her good.
She seems like a changed girl to me.
Maybe we haven’t bent the twig enough.
We’ve spared the rod.
Maybe we were wrong.
Despair settled over him.
There seemed no doubt that it was what Cathy needed.
Ames said, It kind of opened her up.
Ames told the neighbors about it.
She has such a fine color sense—rust and yellow.
She’s finished three squares already.
For her father Cathy kept a ready smile.
Even in school she was changed.
He called on Mr.
Ames at the tannery to discuss it.
She didn’t tell us any of this, Mr.
Ames said proudly.
Well, maybe I shouldn’t have told you.
I hope I haven’t ruined a surprise.
But she was always a good child, said his wife.
And have you noticed how pretty she’s getting?
Why, she’s almost beautiful.
Her cheeks have so much color.
It was true that Cathy glowed.
She had all the time in the world.
And it wasn’t only at home either.
He was amazed at her questions about business.
She might be running the business someday.
I wouldn’t want a child that didn’t have some gumption.
Her mother was dressed to go out.
I have to go to the Altar Guild, she said.
It’s about the cake sale next week.
I’d like to, said Cathy.
Ames, and she hurried out.
Cathy worked quickly but without hurry.
She put on an old apron to cover her clothes.
She looked at her face in the mirror.
Her mother had not been gone even ten minutes.
The Ames house had gone up like a rocket.
Ames and their daughter.
Enough remained of Mr.
Ames to make sure there were two bodies.
He borrowed the coroner’s rake and worked furiously.
And What did you find, George?
Finally the coroner came over to him.
What’s on your mind, George?
No keys in the locks, the chief said uneasily.
Maybe they fell out.
Maybe they melted.
The locks didn’t melt.
Maybe Bill Ames took them out.
On the inside?
He held up his trophies.
Both bolts stuck out.
A broken window showed how the thief had entered.
Now the whole complexion changed.
So, it was not an accident.
The crowd began to spread.
They had not far to go.
The constable took control.
This was his province.
He pushed and herded everyone out of the carriage house.
Want to gum up all the clues?
he shouted at them.
Now you all stay clear outside the door.
Anybody recognize these here?
Every man who is not known is automatically suspected.
And what a turning out those poor gypsies got!
He tried manfully to please these superior beings.
There was something very nice about him.
He felt that at last he amounted to something.
He said he did it.
Peter’s throat with a bowling ball, the judge said.
Be more careful, Mike.
The law was designed to save, not to destroy.
Cathy left a scent of sweetness behind her.
Edwards kept a dustless house and controlled her servants.
There were of course many times when Mr.
He felt his way along and made few mistakes.
He never sent his girls into the cities.
At this time he had ten units.
Scholars have various reasons to give.
It was said that its existence protected decent women.
In the houses they had no responsibility.
This ending was no deterrent.
There was even a special name for the smart ones.
They were grandly called courtesans.
He did not want very pretty girls either.
In spite of this the girls usually chose abortion.
It was not always smooth sailing for Mr.
He did have his problems.
That is how Mr.
He had three units to rebuild from the ground.
I don’t know how Cathy Ames heard about Mr.
Perhaps a hack driver told her.
He had been up all night.
She was far too pretty for his business.
In a word she was not Mr.
Edwards’ kind of girl at all.
Edwards’ body began to feel her.
His reaction startled him.
Her little mouth wore a cat smile.
Edwards leaned forward at his desk, breathing heavily.
He realized that he wanted this one for his own.
My father is dead, Catherine said modestly.
Before he died he had let things go to pieces.
We didn’t know he had borrowed money on the farm.
The shock would kill her.
Catherine’s eyes dimmed with tears.
If ever Mr.
Edwards had a chance it was now.
Edwards was persistently if not profoundly religious.
To her, Mr.
And this is another mystery.
She was content with her life and thankful.
If in all the years Mr.
Edwards had never experienced such misery.
To a certain extent he began to neglect his business.
One thing Mr.
To Catherine, Mr.
And as he had his techniques, so had she hers.
I have to go shopping, you know.
And she made it sound like a lie.
Her method was to keep him continually off balance.
She could convince him.
He could not bring himself to stop it.
She answered his pounding after a long time.
She was afraid, living alone.
Anyone could get in.
She would get him another key—but she never did.
Edwards had her followed—and she did not know how often.
As was proper, Mr.
Edwards had stocked the pretty little nest with champagne.
Catherine had from the first refused to touch it.
It makes me sick, she explained.
I’ve tried it and I can’t drink it.
Nonsense, he said.
Just have one glass.
It can’t hurt you.
No, thank you.
I can’t drink it.
Wine might loosen her tongue.
I tell you, it doesn’t agree with me.
I tell you I don’t want it.
This is silly, he said.
Do you want me to be angry with you?
Then drink a glass.
I don’t want it.
You don’t know.
It’s not good for me.
The blood flowed to her cheeks.
She poured another glass for herself and another.
Her eyes became set and cold.
Edwards felt a fear of her.
I didn’t want to do it.
Remember that, she said calmly.
Maybe you’d better not have any more.
She laughed and poured herself another glass.
It doesn’t matter now, she said.
More won’t make much difference.
She spoke to him softly.
You fat slug, she said.
What do you know about me?
Want me to tell you?
You wonder where a nice girl like me learned tricks.
I’ll tell you.
I learned them in cribs—you hear?
I’ve worked in places you never even heard of—four years.
Sailors brought me little tricks from Port Said.
Catherine, he protested, you don’t know what you’re saying.
I could see it.
You thought I would talk.
Well, I’m talking.
She advanced slowly toward him, and Mr.
Edwards overcame his impulse to edge away.
He was afraid of her but he sat still.
Love to a man like Mr.
Edwards is a crippling emotion.
It ruined his judgment, canceled his knowledge, weakened him.
One day a clipping came from the agency he employed.
Edwards studied it.
For a time he hung suspended, hardly breathing.
Gradually his brain cleared.
Catherine answered it immediately.
She had on her coat and hat.
What a shame!
I must go out for a while.
Edwards put down his suitcase.
No, he said.
She studied him.
Something was changed.
He lumbered past her and went down into the cellar.
Where are you going?
Her voice was shrill.
He did not reply.
He opened his suitcase and put the box inside.
That’s mine, she said softly.
What are you up to?
I thought we’d go for a little trip.
I can’t go.
Little town in Connecticut.
I have some business there.
You told me once you wanted to work.
You’re going to work.
I don’t want to now.
You can’t make me.
Why, I’ll call the police!
He smiled so horribly that she stepped back from him.
His temples were thudding with blood.
Maybe you’d rather go to your home town, he said.
They had a big fire there several years ago.
Do you remember that fire?
What do you want me to do?
she asked quietly.
Just come for a little trip with me.
You said you wanted to work.
She could think of only one plan.
A man couldn’t always watch.
That always worked.
It always had.
But his words had given Catherine real fear.
Catherine was wary and watchful.
She had no access to his plan.
In her purse she had a thin-bladed knife.
Edwards thought he knew what he intended to do.
Then he would throw her out.
The knife did not bother him.
He knew about that.
That took care of the knife.
He thought he only meant to punish her.
After two slashes the quirt was not enough.
He dropped it on the ground and used his fists.
His breathing came out in squealing whines.
Catherine did her best not to fall into panic.
Later he looked down on her beaten face.
Two complete and separate thoughts ran in his mind.
I couldn’t bear to touch her.
Then the sickness that follows rage overwhelmed him.
No question was ever asked of him.
That he had not killed Catherine was an accident.
Every blow had been intended to crush her.
If Cyrus had been dishonest he had done it well.
No one asked questions about the money.
But the subject was on Charles’ mind.
You’re a rich man.
You act like you’re afraid to spend a penny.
I am, said Charles.
I might have to give it back.
Still harping on that?
I don’t know, said Charles.
I’d rather not talk about it.
But that night he brought up the subject again.
There’s one thing bothers me, he began.
About the money?
Yes, about the money.
How do you mean?
Maybe he burned it up.
Maybe he did, said Charles.
He was awake, in fact, a split second before four-thirty.
Charles lighted the candle beside his bed.
He threw back his blanket and got up.
Time to get up.
Adam’s voice was muffled.
Don’t you ever forget?
It’s time to get up.
You don’t have to get up, he said.
You’re a rich man.
You can lay in bed all day.
So are you.
But we still get up before daylight.
You don’t have to get up, Charles repeated.
But if you’re going to farm, you’d better farm.
Come off it, said Charles.
Go back to bed if you want to.
You know what I bet?
Charles went into the kitchen and lighted the lamp.
Adam was watching him through the door.
You wouldn’t use a match, he said.
Charles turned angrily.
You mind your own goddam business.
Stop picking at me.
All right, said Adam.
And maybe my business isn’t here.
That’s up to you.
The quarrel was silly but Adam couldn’t stop it.
You’re damn right I’ll go when I want, he said.
This is my place as much as yours.
Then why don’t you do some work on it?
What are we fussing about?
Let’s not fuss.
I don’t want trouble, said Charles.
The brothers sat down.
Goddam it, can’t you wipe your knife?
Look at that butter!
You better get off the place, he said.
Adam got up.
It was eight months before Charles saw him again.
Hello, said Charles.
How are you?
Fine, said Adam.
Where’d you go?
No place else?
Just looked at the city.
It’s nice in California, he said.
It’s nice in the winter.
And you can raise anything there.
Sure you can raise it.
How about wheat?
They raise a lot of wheat in California.
The rust will get to it, said Charles.
What makes you so sure?
Charles said, Why the hell don’t you go there?
I’ll buy you out any time you say.
They don’t have any winter in California, he said.
It’s just like spring all the time.
I like the winter, said Charles.
Adam came toward the stove.
Don’t be cross, he said.
Well, stop picking at me.
How many eggs?
Four, said Adam.
He put the skillet down next to the flame.
His sullenness left him as he fried the bacon.
Do you really want to go?
That’s what I’m trying to figure out, he said.
I don’t know.
It’s like getting up in the morning.
You sure make a fuss about it.
And here I get up a half-hour before reveille.
He stirred the hissing bacon around with a fork.
Take a look at it, Adam said earnestly.
We don’t have time to look around for a wife.
It’s a damn fine piece, said Charles.
You thinking of getting married?
And that’s what I’m talking about.
Two lonely old farts working our tails off.
What the hell are you talking about?
Fellow can’t get comfortable.
You make me itch.
Get it out—what’s on your mind?
I’m not having any fun, said Adam.
Or anyway I’m not having enough.
Well, why don’t you quit?
Charles shouted at him.
Why don’t you get the hell out?
I don’t see any guards holding you.
Don’t be cross, said Adam quietly.
It’s like getting up.
You make me itch, said Charles.
Think about it, Charles.
You like it here?
And you want to live here all your life?
Jesus, I wish I had it that easy.
What do you suppose is the matter with me?
I think you’ve got knocker fever.
Maybe that’s it, said Adam.
But I never took much satisfaction in a whore.
It’s all the same, Charles said.
You shut your eyes and you can’t tell the difference.
I had one for a while.
Charles turned to him with interest.
How was it?
I mean the other—how was that?
And kind of sweet—kind of soft and sweet.
Kind of gentle and soft.
She was sweet.
You’ve got a funny look in your eye.
I guess you were kind of gone on that squaw.
I guess I was, said Adam.
What happened to her?
You didn’t get another one?
Adam’s eyes were pained.
I’ve heard they can’t stand smallpox.
It kills them, said Adam.
You’re burning that bacon.
Charles turned quickly back to the stove.
It’ll just be crisp, he said, I like it crisp.
There was a schoolteacher, Charles said.
Prettiest thing you ever saw.
Had little tiny feet.
Bought all her clothes in New York.
Yellow hair, and you never saw such little feet.
Sang too, in the choir.
Everybody took to going to church.
Damn near stampeded getting into church.
That was quite a while ago.
I guess so.
What happened to her?
Well, you know how it is.
The women got kind of restless with her here.
They got together.
First thing you knew they had her out.
I heard she wore silk underwear.
Too hoity toity.
School board had her out halfway through the term.
Feet no longer than that.
Showed her ankles too, like it was an accident.
Always showing her ankles.
Did you get to know her?
I only went to church.
Couldn’t hardly get in.
Girl that pretty’s got no right in a little town.
Just makes people uneasy.
Adam said, Remember that Samuels girl?
She was real pretty.
What happened to her?
Just caused trouble.
She went away.
I heard she’s living in Philadelphia.
Maybe we ought to go away from here, Adam said.
Charles said, Still thinking of California?
I guess so.
Charles’ temper tore in two.
I want you out of here!
I want you to get off the place.
I’ll buy you or sell you or anything.
Get out, you son of a bitch— He stopped.
I guess I don’t mean that last.
But goddam it, you make me nervous.
I’ll go, said Adam.
Why don’t you come down?
Six months later there was another card, from Buenos Aires.
Dear Charles—my God this is a big city.
They speak French and Spanish both.
I’m sending you a book.
But no book came.
And instead of the book Adam arrived.
He was brown and his clothes had a foreign look.
How are you?
Did you get the book?
I wonder what happened to it?
It had pictures.
Going to stay?
I guess so.
I’ll tell you about that country.
I don’t want to hear about it, said Charles.
Christ, you’re mean, said Adam.
I can just see it all over again.
Adam asked, Don’t you want me to stay?
Hell, yes, said Charles.
I miss you when you’re not here.
And it was just that way.
That’s half a life.
Here it comes, said Charles.
Wasting your life.
Look, Adam, could we not have a fight this time?
How do you mean?
Adam laughed and the tension went out of the room.
I’ve got a pretty smart brother.
Yes, I like that.
You’re getting rich, aren’t you, Charles?
I’m doing all right.
I wouldn’t say rich.
No, I wouldn’t say it.
But you did.
Charles, you’ve made this about the prettiest farm anywhere about.
We’re not poor people any more.
We don’t need a new house, Charles said gruffly.
You take your fancy ideas away.
You take your fancy ideas away.
Adam was amused.
Say, how would that be?
Then we wouldn’t get on each other’s nerves.
I don’t want it on the place.
The place is half mine.
I’ll buy you out.
But I don’t have to sell.
Charles’ eyes blazed.
I’ll burn your goddam house down.
I believe you would, Adam said, suddenly sobered.
I believe you really would.
What are you looking like that for?
Charles said slowly, I’ve thought about it a lot.
And I’ve wanted for you to bring it up.
I guess you aren’t ever going to.
What do you mean?
You bet I do.
Saved my life, I guess.
You never paid it back.
I must have.
Adam said slowly, I’ll pay you in the morning.
I gave you plenty of time to offer.
Sure you did, Charles.
I should have remembered.
I never asked.
And I never told.
Maybe I was ashamed.
I was a prisoner, Charles.
I broke jail—I escaped.
Charles’ mouth was open.
What are you talking about?
I’m going to tell you.
Got out in six months and picked right up again.
That’s how they get their roads built.
I don’t believe you, Charles said.
Yes, I do.
You don’t tell lies.
Of course I believe you.
Why didn’t you tell me?
Maybe I was ashamed.
But I’m more ashamed that I didn’t pay you.
Oh, forget it, said Charles.
I don’t know why I mentioned it.
Good God, no.
I’ll pay you in the morning.
I’ll be damned, said Charles.
My brother a jailbird!
You don’t have to look so happy.
My brother a jailbird!
Two or three reasons, he said.
That makes sense, said Charles.
But you said there was one more reason.
I figured I owed the state six months.
That was the sentence.
I didn’t feel right about cheating.
I only cheated three days.
Charles exploded with laughter.
But you say you robbed a store.
Charles leaned forward.
Tell me about the road gang, Adam.
Sure I will, Charles.
Sure I will.
Adam took some advantage of it too.
He tempted Charles.
All right, what do we want?
We could go to Europe, we could walk around Paris.
I thought I heard someone on the stoop.
Probably a cat.
I guess so.
Have to kill off some of them pretty soon.
Those goddam cats!
He moved beside him.
One skinny hand clawed slowly at the stairs.
The other dragged helplessly.
Adam went down the stairs and kneeled beside the figure.
Give me a hand, he said.
Come on, let’s get her in.
Here—look out for that arm.
It looks broken.
She fainted when they carried her in.
Put her in my bed, Adam said.
Now I think you better go for the doctor.
Are you crazy?
Maybe not as crazy as you.
Think about it a minute.
For God’s sake, think about what?
Adam was shocked.
You don’t mean it.
I mean it all right.
I think we better take her in.
It’ll be all over the county in two hours.
How do you know what she is?
How’d she get here?
What happened to her?
Adam, you’re taking an awful chance.
I think you’re making a mistake.
I’ll go, but I tell you we’ll suffer for it.
I’ll do the suffering, said Adam.
His mind went back—it was this room, this bed.
And she had said something over and over.
You’ll be all right, he said to the girl.
We’re getting a doctor.
He’ll be here right off.
Her lips moved a little.
Don’t try to talk, he said.
Don’t try to say anything.
You can stay here, he said.
You can stay here as long as you want.
I’ll take care of you.
There, does that hurt?
The poor eyes—I’ll put some brown paper over your eyes.
You’ll be all right.
That’s a bad one on your forehead.
I’m afraid you’ll have a scar there.
Could you tell me your name?
No, don’t try.
There’s lots of time.
There’s lots of time.
Do you hear that?
That’s the doctor’s rig.
Wasn’t that quick?
He moved to the kitchen door.
In here, Doc.
She’s in here, he called.
She was very badly hurt.
As it was he found enough.
So much the doctor could see and identify.
His patient was asleep before he left the room.
All right, what happened to her?
How do we know?
Charles said truculently.
We found her on our porch.
Know who she is?
You go upstairs at the inn—is she anybody from there?
I haven’t been there lately.
I couldn’t recognize her in that condition anyway.
The doctor turned his head toward Adam.
You ever see her before?
Adam shook his head slowly.
Charles said harshly, Say, what you mousing around at?
I’ll tell you, since you’re interested.
If you want the truth, somebody tried to kill her.
Why don’t you ask her?
She won’t be talking for quite a while.
Adam spoke so explosively that the two looked at him.
Let her alone.
Let her rest.
Who’s going to take care of her?
I am, said Adam.
Now, you look here— Charles began.
Keep out of it!
It’s my place as much as yours.
Do you want me to go?
I didn’t mean that.
Well, I’ll go if she has to go.
The doctor said, Steady down.
What makes you so interested?
I wouldn’t put a hurt dog out.
You wouldn’t get mad about it either.
Are you holding something back?
Did you go out last night?
Did you do it?
He was here all night, said Charles.
He snores like a goddam train.
Adam said, Why can’t you let her be?
Let her get well.
The doctor stood up and dusted his hands.
I know you and your family.
You aren’t stupid.
Have to talk to you like a baby.
That girl was assaulted.
I believe whoever did it tried to kill her.
I admit I break a few, but not that one.
Well, tell him.
But don’t let him bother her until she’s better.
You still want to keep her here?
I’ll look in tomorrow.
He stalked out.
Charles turned on his brother.
Adam, for God’s sake, what is this?
Let me alone.
What’s got into you?
Let me alone—you hear?
Just let me alone.
Adam was glad he was gone.
The girl snored thickly through the morpnine.
Adam sat very still, looking at her.
It was a child’s hand, almost ä baby’s hand.
Her wrist was warm.
Adam chuckled with delight.
She was aware of movement around her.
Gradually her head and her eyes cleared.
She saw the face of Mr.
Edwards knew about the fire.
Did anyone else?
And how did he know?
Maybe the sheriff knew about the fire.
Raised voices gave her the cue to her method.
The sheriff said, She must have a name.
Somebody must know her.
How could she answer?
Her jaw is broken.
If she’s right-handed she could spell out answers.
How do you know she can remember?
Well, you give me paper and pencil and we’ll see.
I don’t want you to bother her.
Adam, goddam it, it doesn’t matter what you want.
I’m telling you I want a paper and pencil.
Then the other young man’s voice.
What’s the matter with you?
Give him a pencil.
She’s asleep, Adam whispered.
She opened her eyes and looked at them.
The tall man came to the side of the bed.
I don’t want to bother you, Miss.
I’m the sheriff.
She tried to nod and winced with pain.
She blinked her eyes rapidly to indicate assent.
That’s the girl, said the sheriff.
She wants to.
There we are.
What is your name?
The three men watched her face.
Her mouth grew thin and her eyes squinted.
She closed her eyes and the pencil began to move.
I don’t know, it scrawled in huge letters.
Here, now there’s a fresh sheet.
What do you remember?
Don’t you remember who you are, where you came from?
Poor child, the sheriff said.
I thank you for trying anyway.
When you get better we’ll try again.
No, you don’t have to write any more.
The pencil wrote, Thank you, and fell from her fingers.
She had won the sheriff.
He ranged himself with Adam.
Only Charles was against her.
Once he caught her watching.
He looked guiltily at his fingers.
Charles said brutally, Don’t you worry.
She smiled at him, and he looked away.
Adam couldn’t remember ever having been so happy.
Cathy’s vitality was great.
She began to recover very quickly.
She spoke little even when it was not so difficult.
One afternoon she heard someone moving around in the kitchen.
She called, Adam, is it you?
Charles’ voice answered, No, it’s me.
Would you come in here just a minute, please?
He stood in the doorway.
His eyes were sullen.
You don’t come in much, she said.
You don’t like me.
I guess that’s right too.
Will you tell me why?
He struggled to find an answer.
I don’t trust you.
I don’t know.
And I don’t believe you lost your memory.
But why should I lie?
I don’t know.
That’s why I don’t trust you.
There’s something—I almost recognize.
You never saw me in your life.
But there’s something that bothers me—that I ought to know.
And how do you know I never saw you?
She was silent, and he moved to leave.
Don’t go, she said.
What do you intend to do?
He regarded her with a new interest.
You want the truth?
Why else would I ask?
I don’t know, but I’ll tell you.
Could you do that?
He’s a big man.
I could do it.
She regarded him levelly.
Where is Adam?
You’re a mean man.
You know what I think?
I think you’re a devil.
She laughed softly.
That makes two of us, she said.
Charles, how long do I have?
How long before you put me out?
Tell me truly.
All right, I will.
About a week or ten days.
Soon as you can get around.
Suppose I don’t go.
All right, I’ll tell you.
I don’t believe that.
All right, don’t.
I don’t believe I said anything bad.
What could I say?
I won’t argue with you.
And I’ve got work to do.
You asked me and I told you.
He went outside.
I thought she was smarter, he said to himself.
And he felt more easy than he had for days.
Charles had frightened her badly.
Cathy followed his thinking, and it did not reassure her.
Her money was gone.
He poured a tablespoonful.
This will taste horrible, he said.
It’s good stuff though.
You’re good to me, she said.
I wonder why?
I’ve brought you trouble.
You have not.
You’ve brightened up the whole house.
Never complain or anything, hurt as bad as you are.
You’re so good, so kind.
I want to be.
Do you have to go out?
Couldn’t you stay and talk to me?
Sure I could.
There’s nothing so important to do.
Draw up a chair, Adam, and sit down.
So good and kind, she repeated.
Adam, you keep promises, don’t you?
I try to.
What are you thinking about?
I’m alone and I’m afraid, she cried.
Can’t I help you?
I don’t think anyone can help me.
Tell me and let me try.
That’s the worst part.
I can’t even tell you.
If it’s a secret I won’t tell it.
It’s not my secret, don’t you see?
No, I don’t.
Her fingers gripped his hand tightly.
Adam, I didn’t ever lose my memory.
That’s what I’m trying to tell you.
Did you love your father, Adam?
I guess I revered him more than loved him.
I guess I would.
Well, that’s how it is with me.
But how did you get hurt?
That’s part of it.
That’s why I can’t tell.
Was it your father?
But it’s all tied up together.
He would make up the story himself.
Adam, will you trust me?
It’s an awful thing to ask.
No, it isn’t, not if you’re protecting your father.
You understand, it’s not my secret.
If it were I’d tell you in a minute.
Of course I understand.
I’d do the same thing myself.
Oh, you understand so much.
Tears welled up in her eyes.
Don’t you worry, he said.
I’ll take care of you.
She lay back against the pillow.
I don’t think you can.
What do you mean?
Well, your brother doesn’t like me.
He wants me to get out of here.
Did he tell you that?
I can just feel it.
He hasn’t your understanding.
He has a good heart.
I know that, but he doesn’t have your kindness.
He stared into space.
My brother can’t make you go.
I own half of this farm.
I have my own money.
If he wanted me to go I would have to.
I can’t spoil your life.
Adam stood up and strode out of the room.
Adam looked up at the sky.
And all these sounds related into a kind of music.
His eyes were clear too.
There was change in everything.
Adam looked back at his brother.
No time had passed.
Charles was still struggling with the same large stone.
Suddenly he knew joy and sorrow felted into one fabric.
Courage and fear were one thing too.
She smiled weakly at him, and he thought.
What a child!
What a helpless child!
and a surge of love filled him.
Will you marry me?
Her face tightened and her hand closed convulsively.
You don’t have to tell me now, he said.
I want you to think about it.
But if you would marry me I could protect you.
No one could hurt you again.
Cathy recovered in an instant.
Come here, Adam.
There, sit down.
Here, give me your hand.
That’s good, that’s right.
My dear, she said brokenly.
Oh, my dear.
Look, Adam, you have trusted me.
Now will you promise me something?
Asked you to marry me?
Why shouldn’t I?
It’s not that.
I want this night to think.
I’ll want maybe more than this night.
Could you let me do that?
She raised her hand to her head.
You know I’m not sure I can think straight.
And I want to.
Do you think you might marry me?
Let me alone to think.
Please, my dear.
He smiled and said nervously, Don’t make it long.
Just let me think.
And, Adam—you’re a kind man.
She leaned forward and looked at her face.
The bandage was still on her forehead.
She was afraid.
She needed protection and money.
Adam could give her both.
And she could control him—she knew that.
Only one thing bothered her.
Edwards had really frightened her.
She determined never to let it happen again.
She felt a kinship to Charles.
She didn’t mind his suspicion of her.
Charles straightened up when Adam approached.
My God, there’s lots of rocks, he said.
There’ll be something else, said Charles.
What’s a few stones?
I guess you’re right.
I thought I would give you a hand.
That’s nice of you.
How long is she going to stay?
You’d never think what happened to him.
He’s found a fortune.
How do you mean?
What about it?
Alex went in between those trees and his stone wall.
He was hunting rabbits.
Soaked up with rain though.
Looked like it had been there some time.
And he found a purse too.
There wasn’t anything in it.
No name or.
It’s just like the fellow didn’t want to be traced.
Is Alex going to keep it?
Somebody’s sure to claim it.
I guess so.
I didn’t tell Alex that.
He’s feeling so good about it.
That’s a lot of money, Adam said.
Somebody’s bound to claim it.
Alex hung around for a while.
You know, his wife goes around a lot.
Charles was silent.
Adam, he said finally, we got to have a talk.
The whole county’s doing plenty of talking.
What do you mean?
Goddam it, about that—that girl.
Two men can’t have a girl living with them.
Alex says the women are pretty riled up about it.
Adam, we can’t have it.
We live here.
We’ve got a good name.
You want me to throw her out before she’s well?
I want you to get rid of her—get her out.
I don’t like her.
You never have.
I know it.
I don’t trust her.
When you going to get her out?
Tell you what, Adam said slowly.
Sure I promise.
Well, that’s something.
I’ll get the word to Alex’s wife.
From there on she’ll handle the news.
I don’t suppose her memory’s come back?
No, said Adam.
Charles was home when they returned.
We got married, Adam said simply.
Cathy smiled at Charles.
Why did you do it?
Can’t a man get married?
Cathy went quickly into the bedroom and closed the door.
Charles began to rave.
She’s no damn good, I tell you.
She’s a whore.
I tell you, she’s just a two-bit whore.
Charles, stop it!
Stop it, I tell you!
You keep your filthy mouth shut about my wife!
She’s no more a wife than an alley cat.
Adam said slowly, I think you’re jealous, Charles.
I think you wanted to marry her.
Why, you goddam fool!
I won’t live in the same house with her!
Adam said evenly, You won’t have to.
I’m going away.
You can buy me out if you want.
You can have the farm.
You always wanted it.
You can stay here and rot.
Charles’ voice lowered.
Won’t you get rid of her?
Throw her out.
She’ll tear you to pieces.
She’ll destroy you, Adam, she’ll destroy you!
How do you know so much about her?
Charles’ eyes were bleak.
I don’t, he said, and his mouth snapped shut.
We’re going to go away, he said.
Let me go away.
Please, let me.
I don’t want to make you hate your brother.
I wonder why he hates me?
I think he’s jealous.
Her eyes narrowed.
That’s what it looks like to me.
You don’t have to worry.
We’re getting out.
We’re going to California.
She said quietly, I don’t want to go to California.
Why, it’s nice there, sun all the time and beautiful.
I don’t want to go to California.
You are my wife, he said softly.
I want you to go with me.
She was silent and did not speak of it again.
He’ll get a little drunk and he’ll feel better.
Cathy modestly looked at her fingers.
I know, he said.
But I want you to stay with me.
I’m afraid of Charles.
He hates me so.
I’ll bring my cot in here.
Then you can call me if you’re frightened.
You can reach out and touch me.
You’re so good, she said.
Could we have some tea?
Why, sure, I’d like some myself.
He settled himself in a chair near her bed.
It’s pretty strong.
Is it too strong for you?
I like it strong.
He finished his cup.
Does it taste strange to you?
It’s got a funny taste.
Her hand flew to her mouth.
Oh, let me taste it.
She sipped the dregs.
Adam, she cried, you got the wrong cup—that was mine.
It had my medicine in it.
He licked his lips.
I guess it can’t hurt me.
No, it can’t.
She laughed softly.
What do you mean?
Well, you drank my sleeping medicine.
Maybe you wouldn’t wake up easily.
Did the doctor tell you to take this much?
he asked thickly.
You’re just not used to it, she said.
Charles came back at eleven o’clock.
Cathy heard his tipsy footsteps.
Cathy was standing by his bed.
What do you want?
What do you think?
Move over a little.
He drank my sleeping medicine by mistake.
Move over a little.
He breathed harshly.
I already been with a whore.
You’re a pretty strong boy.
Move over a little.
How about your broken arm?
I’ll take care of that.
It’s not your worry.
Suddenly Charles laughed.
And man’s freedom was boiling off.
Where did all the good stones go, and all simplicity?
You can remember only that you had them.
He’ll catch a cold.
History was secreted in the glands of a million historians.
Just got going when the British took us on again.
We beat them, but it didn’t do us much good.
The Mexican War did two good things though.
Can you keep a slave?
Well if you bought him in good faith, why not?
Next they’ll be saying a man can’t have a horse.
Who is it wants to take my property?
There came boom and bust, bankruptcy, depression.
To hell with that rotten century!
Let’s close it like a book and go on reading!
New chapter, new life.
It’s a fair thing ahead.
There’s no rot on this clean new hundred years.
It happens to nearly everyone.
This in my time is the danger.
What do I believe in?
Nothing was ever created by two men.
The preciousness lies in the lonely mind of a man.
This is what I am and what I am about.
If the glory can be killed, we are lost.
The brothers were strangers now.
He paid the girl and then could not perform.
He cried in her arms until she put him out.
No claim was too extravagant—wealth was unlimited.
Its rails extended down the valleys.
The long Salinas Valley was part of the exploitation.
Adam did not rush at his purchase.
It was not speculation with Adam.
He had only one worry, and that was for Cathy.
She was not well.
Luckily Adam found Dr.
Why don’t you wait downstairs?
Is she all right?
I’ll call you pretty soon.
Adam patted Cathy’s shoulder, and she smiled up at him.
His face was red with anger.
Why did you do it?
Cathy’s mouth was a thin tight line.
Does your husband know you are pregnant?
Her head moved slowly from side to side.
What did you do it with?
She stared up at him.
He looked around the room.
He shook it in her face.
The old offender—the old criminal, he said.
You’re a fool.
You’ve nearly killed yourself and you haven’t lost your baby.
Some of the things you women do!
Her eyes were as cold as glass.
He pulled a chair up beside her bed.
Why don’t you want to have the baby?
he asked softly.
You’ve got a good husband.
Don’t you love him?
Don’t you intend to speak to me at all?
Tell me, damn it!
Don’t turn mulish.
My dear, he said, can’t you see?
You must not destroy life.
That’s the one thing gets me crazy.
God knows I lose patients because I don’t know enough.
But I try—I always try.
And then I see a deliberate killing.
He talked rapidly on.
He dreaded the sick silence between his sentences.
This woman puzzled him.
There was something inhuman about her.
Have you met Mrs.
She’s wasting and crying for a baby.
All right, he cried, you won’t speak—you don’t have to.
But I’m going to tell you.
The baby is safe.
Your aim was bad.
And I’m telling you this—you’re going to have that baby.
You don’t have to answer, but you listen to me!
Cathy moistened her lips with a little pointed tongue.
I’m sorry, she said.
But you don’t understand.
Then why don’t you tell me?
His anger disappeared like mist.
Tell me, my dear.
It’s hard to tell.
Adam is so good, so strong.
I am—well, I’m tainted.
No, but my grandfather and my father—and my brother.
She covered her eyes with her hands.
I couldn’t bring that to my husband.
Poor child, he said.
My poor child.
You can’t be certain.
Will you promise me not to try any more tricks?
All right then.
I won’t tell your husband what you did.
I’ll look in tomorrow morning, he said.
Tilson warded off a flurry of How is she?
Is she all right?
What caused it?
Can I go up?
Whoa, hold up—hold up.
And he used his trick, his standard joke.
Your wife is sick.
Your wife is going to have a baby.
He brushed past Adam and left him staring.
Three men sitting around the stove grinned at him.
His hint was wasted.
Adam bolted clumsily up the narrow stairs.
Bordoni’s great-grandfather from the Spanish crown.
The Bordonis were Swiss, but Mrs.
The original Sanchez house was still usable.
There is only one drawback to this building method.
Rats will gnaw at the hide if they are let.
Bordoni used it for a cow barn.
He wanted to sell the ranch and go home.
But he went through all the motions of carefulness.
Over and over he asked Cathy’s opinion of the place.
Did she like it?
Would she be happy there?
And he didn’t listen to her noncommittal answers.
He thought that she linked arms with his enthusiasm.
It’s water I think about, he said one evening.
A rancher crossed his denim knees.
You ought to go see Sam Hamilton, he said.
He knows more about water than anybody around here.
He’s a water witch and a well-digger too.
He’ll tell you.
His companion chuckled.
How do I find him?
I’ll tell you what.
I’m going out to have him make some angle irons.
I’ll take you with me if you want.
You’ll like Mr.
He’s a fine man.
Kind of a comical genius, his companion said.
Now I’ll have to tell you, Louis said.
Hamilton will like that, but Mrs.
Hamilton has got a skunner on it.
That’s what we always do.
Doesn’t she let her husband take a drink?
No bigger than a bird, said Louis.
But she’s got brassbound opinions.
Just you leave the bottle under the seat.
It’s not likely looking country, Adam said.
The ranch don’t feed them.
It’s a fine family.
I’ll tell you, he said.
Take me—my father was Italian.
My place isn’t very big but it’s nice.
My father bought it.
He picked it out.
I’m comfortably off, said Adam modestly.
I’m talking the long way around, said Louis.
There’s people say they don’t know how the Hamiltons lived.
But of course Mr.
Hamilton went right to work—that’s how they lived.
Must have made a go of it.
I hear of him all over.
He made a go of it all right.
Raised nine children.
I’ll bet he hasn’t got four bits laid away.
How could he?
I’ll be glad to talk to him, said Adam.
All doing well—maybe except Joe.
Hamilton can be proud.
It’s real godforsaken country, said Louis.
Makes me feel mean, said Adam.
Me too, and I don’t feel mean.
I’m just goddam glad.
He don’t talk like other people.
He’s an Irishman.
And he’s all full of plans—a hundred plans a day.
And he’s all full of hope.
Adam was alarmed at the hint of threat.
I just wanted you to get it straight.
And he’s raised the nicest family you’re likely to see.
I just want you to remember that.
Thanks for telling me.
Louis faced around front again.
There he is—see, out by the shop?
He must of heard us.
Has he got a beard?
Adam asked, peering.
Yes, got a nice beard.
It’s turning white fast, beginning to grizzle up.
They drove past the frame house and saw Mrs.
Only his hands were blackened from the forge.
Louis, he said, I’m glad to see you.
He smiled at Adam, and Louis said, I brought Mr.
Adam Trask to see you.
He’s a stranger from down east, come to settle.
I’m glad, said Samuel.
We’ll shake another time.
I wouldn’t soil your hand with these forge hooks.
I brought some strap iron, Mr.
Would you make some angles for me?
Sure I will, Louis.
Get down, get down.
We’ll put the horses to the shade.
There’s a piece of venison behind, and Mr.
Trask brought a little something.
Samuel glanced toward the house.
Louis, will you out-span your team?
I’ll take the vension in.
Liza will be glad.
She likes a venison stew.
Any of the young ones home?
Well, no, they aren’t.
They’ll come trooping back by dusk.
We lack a sofa because of that.
I’ll tell you later.
They heard him calling as he came near the house.
Liza, you’ll never guess.
She must be a holy terror.
No bigger than a bird but she’s brassbound.
 Out-span,’  Adam said.
Samuel rejoined them in the shop.
She didn’t expect us, Adam protested.
She’ll make some extra dumplings for the stew.
It’s a pleasure to have you here.
Here, Louis, he said, wave your wing on my fire.
Slow, man, slow and even.
He laid the strips of iron on the glowing coke.
No, sir, Mr.
Trask, Liza’s used to cooking for nine starving children.
Nothing can startle her.
My wife is rumbling like round stones in the surf.
It’s a word of anger and sorrow to Liza.
You said something about it, Adam said.
Louis knows him.
Sure I know him, Louis said.
Samuel went on, My Tom is a hell-bent boy.
Always takes more on his plate than he can eat.
Always plants more than he can harvest.
Pleasures too much, sorrows too much.
Some people are like that.
Liza thinks I’m like that.
I don’t know what will come to Tom.
Maybe greatness, maybe the noose—well, Hamiltons have been hanged before.
And I’ll tell you about that sometime.
The sofa, Adam suggested politely.
And of course the girls were asked.
He asked two Williams sisters, Jennie and Belle.
How many screw holes do you want, Louis?
Five, said Louis.
Now I must tell you, Mr.
This takes him quite a piece of time.
You notice the wagon house was empty?
Samuel’s blue eyes shone with pleasure.
For good or bad, Liza was taking her nap.
Tom sat on the steps and thought it out.
That I would, said Samuel.
Uisquebaugh—it’s an Irish word—whisky, water of life—and so it is.
I thank you, said Louis.
How much will that be?
The pleasure of your company.
It’s always like that, Louis said helplessly.
That reminds me—Mr.
I know it well, said Samuel.
It’s a fine piece.
I haven’t made up my mind, said Adam.
I’m just asking some questions.
Oh, Lord, man, now you’ve put your foot in it.
I’ve heard two ways of looking at it.
Naturally I favor the second—Liza says to a fault.
What do you want to know?
Well, take the Bordoni place.
How deep would you have to go to get water?
But you could develop water?
Nearly every place except my own.
I’ve heard you have a lack here.
Why, God in heaven must have heard!
I’ve screamed it loud enough.
There’s a four-hundred-acre piece beside the river.
Would there be water under it?
I’d have to look.
It seems to me it’s an odd valley.
A hungry man gorges with his mind—he does indeed.
Louis Lippo said, Mr.
Trask is from New England.
He plans to settle here.
He’s been west before though—in the army, fighting Indians.
Were you now?
Then it’s you should talk and let me learn.
I don’t want to talk about it.
I didn’t want to fight them, sir.
The sir crept in without his knowing it.
Yes, I can understand that.
Maybe that makes it easier, said Louis.
You have a point, Louis.
What time is it?
Louis stepped out and looked at the sun.
Not past ten o’clock.
If I get started I have no self-control.
He sighed and sat down on a nail keg.
Do you find it strange, Louis?
No, I never been out of it.
I’ve dug into it plenty, Samuel said.
Something went on under it—maybe still is going on.
There’s an ocean bed underneath, and below that another world.
But that needn’t bother a farming man.
Now, on top is good soil, particularly on the flats.
That’s from about Gonzales north to the river mouth.
My children, when I have them, will be on it.
It’s a clay, hard-packed, and it feels greasy too.
And this hard-pan resists water.
And that’s one of the main curses of our valley.
Well, it’s a pretty good place to live, isn’t it?
I punched a hole through the hard-pan and blasted.
That broke it up and the water could get down.
But, God in heaven, think of the amount of dynamite!
He’s never satisfied with the way they are.
Samuel smiled at him.
They say men lived in trees one time.
And then he laughed again.
But God saw this world.
I’ll never see mine except—this way.
This will be a valley of great richness one day.
It could feed the world, and maybe it will.
Where else could I raise my children with that coming?
Samuel went on, There’s one thing I don’t understand.
There’s a blackness on this valley.
His voice rose.
There’s a black violence on this valley.
I don’t know—I don’t know.
It’s as secret as hidden sorrow.
I just remembered I promised to get back early.
Cathy, my wife, is going to have a baby.
But Liza’s getting ready.
She’ll understand when you tell her about the baby.
My wife is feeling poorly.
And I thank you for telling me about the water.
Have I depressed you with my rambling?
No, not at all—not at all.
It’s Cathy’s first baby and she’s miserable.
One thing sets off a hundred others.
The problem is to decide which one to tell first.
The country schools were the centers of culture then.
The schoolhouse was the meeting place for music, for debate.
The polls were set in the schoolhouse for elections.
They had a pride that transcended their poverty.
No one ever thought of them as deserving pity.
Samuel raised a distinctly superior breed.
Olive Hamilton became a teacher.
It required great tact to be a schoolteacher.
The teacher had no private life.
She was watched jealously for any weakness of character.
Teachers rarely lasted very long in the country schools.
Salinas had tempted her.
There was a wall against learning.
More might make them dissatisfied and flighty.
She was as intuitive as a cat.
Her acts were based on feelings rather than thoughts.
Her method was practical.
I got well.
I fell back in bed, crying, I can’t do it!
I can’t get up!
Olive fixed me with her terrible eye.
He has gone into debt for you.
Now get up!
And I got up.
The word had connotations of dirt and slovenliness and dishonor.
Olive never accepted the time-payment plan when it became popular.
Olive had great courage.
Perhaps it takes courage to raise children.
Her thinking was not international.
Martin Hopps lived around the corner from us.
He was wide, short, red-haired.
His mouth was wide, and he had red eyes.
He was almost the shyest boy in Salinas.
But they didn’t know or they were stupid.
She had liked Martin Hopps.
He had never hurt anyone.
She cast about for a weapon.
Knitting helmets and socks was not deadly enough for her.
Olive wanted blood for the life of Martin Hopps.
She found her weapon in Liberty bonds.
She brought ferocity to her work.
I think she made people afraid not to buy them.
Oh, we were proud kids!
Even vicariously this was an eminence we could hardly stand.
One was a bad Hamilton and another was the airplane.
Not to have gone would have let her family down.
She bought all new underwear.
We had to help her out of the car.
The wings were covered with canvas.
Olive was stunned.
She looked like a goggled ball.
She filled the opening completely.
Then to our horror it seemed to stagger and fall.
It fell endlessly, caught itself, climbed, and made a loop.
One of the sergeants laughed.
She’s not a young woman.
The motor died.
The pilot climbed out, shaking his head in perplexity.
Goddamest woman I ever saw, he said.
She was so rigid they could not bend her.
What had happened came out slowly.
He meant no harm.
He shouted something, and his face looked contorted.
Olive could not hear over the noise of the engine.
The pilot throttled down and shouted, Stunt?
It was a kind of joke.
What Olive heard was the word stuck.
Here was her death.
It was all in a second.
She decided to encourage him.
She smiled and nodded again.
I tore up the rule book and she wanted more.
Good Christ, what a pilot she would have made!
Adam sat like a contented cat on his land.
Adams had decided to live in the old house.
Here was a place in which to plant his dynasty.
He planned a permanent seat.
Adam foretasted comfort for himself and his descendants.
He would have good living too.
His men worked deliberately and slowly.
It was a long job.
Adam wanted it well done.
And he shook off the memories.
But Adam was unhurried.
I want it built strong, he directed over and over.
He was not alone in his preoccupation with the future.
The whole valley, the whole West was that way.
It’ll be—who knows?
maybe in our lifetime, they said.
That’s fifteen thousand dollars right there.
Can you imagine?
Why, it will be a frigging garden!
maybe in our lifetime.
He’s haywire now.
Just let us get it, and we’ll show you happiness.
These two gifts gave her great advantages.
Her pregnancy had been an accident.
This does not mean that she reconciled herself to pregnancy.
Her marriage to Adam had been the same.
Her self was an island.
How was the valley then?
He must have planned so carefully.
You know, he had pipes?
We dug up some pieces of it.
That’s remarkable, she said.
He must have been clever.
I’d like to know more about him.
He was a Spaniard, wasn’t he?
They’re artistic people, I’ve heard.
I wonder where I could find out about old Sanchez.
Well, somebody must know.
You know what I wonder about most?
She smiled and looked down and away from him.
The things you say.
He must have had!
He must have had.
Adam, you embarrass me.
Adam, be careful.
Don’t joggle me, it hurts.
I’m so clumsy.
No, you’re not.
You just don’t think.
Should I be knitting or sewing, do you suppose?
I’m so comfortable just sitting.
We’ll buy everything we need.
You just sit and be comfortable.
But the pay—the pay is wonderful.
The doctor said it would fade in time.
Don’t you think it’s darker today?
No, I don’t.
But it was.
Don’t, she said.
It’s tender to the touch.
It turns red if you touch it.
It will go away.
Just takes a little time, that’s all.
She shifted her body restlessly.
The baby was kicking.
She relaxed and all her muscles loosened.
Missy likee tea?
No—yes, I would too.
He made her uneasy.
But Lee’s brain gave and repelled like rubber.
But he was a good and respectful servant—the best.
And what harm could he do her?
An umber tone came to the grass.
If the countryside is not green it is dying.
Lee folded his hands in his sleeves and waited.
Samuel read the note.
Why don’t I go with you?
You might need some help.
I’d like to go—it’s Mr.
Trask, isn’t it?
I didn’t meet him when he came here.
You’ll do that when the digging starts.
I’m older than you.
I’ve got first claim on the talk.
You know how clever they are.
See this piece here?
It screws on and turns down here.
You couldn’t get out of that yourself.
I’m not so clever as a coon.
I think you’ve worked it out, though.
I bling lig, said Lee.
Well, I have to come home some time.
I bling back.
Nonsense, said Samuel.
I’ll lead my horse in and ride back.
What’s your name?
Samuel asked pleasantly.
Got more name.
Lee papa family name.
I’ve read quite a lot about China.
You born in China?
Me talkee Chinese talk, he said.
Well, I guess you have your reasons.
And it’s not my affair.
It’s more than a convenience, he said.
It’s even more than self-protection.
Samuel showed no sign of having observed any change.
Pidgin they expect, and pidgin they’ll listen to.
Can that be possible?
How do I understand you?
That’s why I’m talking to you.
I hadn’t thought of it.
You know, I’m very glad to talk to you.
I’ve wanted to ask so many questions.
Happy to oblige.
So many questions.
For instance, you wear the queue.
That is true.
Talkee Chinese talk.
Queue Chinese fashion—you savvy?
Samuel laughed loudly.
That does have the green touch of convenience, he said.
I wish I had a hidey-hole like that.
I’m wondering whether I can explain, said Lee.
Where there is no likeness of experience it’s very difficult.
I understand you were not born in America.
No, in Ireland.
I tried it.
I had to give it up.
Time for lunch, he said.
I made a package.
Would you like some?
Sure I would.
Let me get down in the shade there.
I’m interested in what you say.
It has a sweet sound of authority.
Lee smiled satirically at him.
I did go back to China.
My father was a fairly successful man.
It didn’t work.
They wouldn’t have me.
I’ll have to believe you because it’s reasonable.
Do you mind my questions?
As a matter of fact, no.
I write a great deal to keep my English up.
Hearing and reading aren’t the same as speaking and writing.
Don’t you ever make a mistake?
I mean, break into English?
No, I don’t.
I think it’s a matter of what is expected.
I guess that’s right, said Samuel.
There’s your pidgin and your queue.
But they tell jokes because it’s expected of them.
Lee unwrapped a little bottle.
Would you like some of this?
Chinese drink ng-ka-py.
What is it?
It softens the world.
Samuel sipped from the bottle.
Tastes a little like rotten apples, he said.
Yes, but nice rotten apples.
Taste it back along your tongue toward the roots.
Samuel took a big swallow and tilted his head back.
I see what you mean.
That is good.
Here are some sandwiches, pickles, cheese, a can of buttermilk.
You do well.
Yes, I see to it.
Samuel bit into a sandwich.
I was shuffling over half a hundred questions.
What you said brings the brightest one up.
You don’t mind?
Not at all.
I’ll try, said Samuel.
If I slip, just remember that I’m a comical genius.
I think I can guess what your next question is.
Why am I content to be a servant?
How in the world did you know?
It seemed to follow.
Do you resent the question?
Not from you.
There are no ugly questions except those clothed in condescension.
I don’t know where being a servant came into disrepute.
He’ll keep a bad servant rather than change.
Finally, in my circumstances I am unprotected.
My master will defend me, protect me.
You have to work and worry.
I work less and worry less.
And I am a good servant.
Samuel leaned toward him, listening intently.
It’s a very short distance to the Sanchez place.
Why did we stop so near?
Allee time talkee.
Me Chinee number one boy.
You leddy go now?
But it must be a lonely life.
That’s the only fault with it, said Lee.
Like a laundry?
Or a grocery store?
Too many Chinese laundries and restaurants.
I thought perhaps a bookstore.
I’d like that, and the competition wouldn’t be too great.
I probably won’t do it though.
A servant loses his initiative.
In the afternoon Samuel and Adam rode over the land.
Oh, it’s a good piece, Samuel cried.
It’s a rare piece of land.
No, it’s just moving over a little.
Well, I don’t like the wind.
Makes me nervous.
Nobody likes wind for very long.
It makes animals nervous and restless too.
Eucalyptus—comes from Australia.
They say the gums grow ten feet a year.
Good idea, Adam said.
What I really want is water.
This wind would pump all the water I could find.
I might try some beans.
Samuel squinted into the wind.
It’s my own invention.
A windmill is a pretty costly thing.
That’s good, said Adam.
I wouldn’t mind the wind if it worked for me.
And if I could get water I might plant alfalfa.
It’s never brought much of a price.
I wasn’t thinking of that.
Some Swiss have moved in there.
I heard about them.
They brought in Swiss cows.
Adam’s face was bright with plans.
That’s what I want to do.
Sell butter and cheese and feed the milk to pigs.
You’re going to bring credit to the valley, Samuels said.
You’re going to be a real joy to the future.
If I can get water.
I’ll get you water if there’s any to be got.
I’ll find it.
I brought my magic wand.
He patted a forked stick tied to his saddle.
I put an auger down.
Think you could get water there?
I don’t know, Samuel said.
His steps took a zigzag course.
Adam rode slowly behind, leading the other horse.
Adam kept his eyes on the stick.
Samuel’s face was taut with attention.
I can get water here, he said.
And not very deep.
The pull was strong, plenty of water.
Good, said Adam.
I want to show you a couple more places.
Now there’s a whole world of water here, he said.
The third try was not so productive.
After half an hour he had only the slightest sign.
The two men rode slowly back toward the Trask house.
I knew it was a good place, Samuel said.
Anyone can see that.
But I didn’t know it was that good.
You know how to pick land, Mr.
We had a farm in Connecticut, he said.
For six generations we dug stones out.
I thought that was the way all farms were.
It’s strange to me and almost sinful here.
The ways of sin are curious, Samuel observed.
They’re the last things we’ll give up.
Maybe that’s a good thing to keep us humble.
The fear of God in us.
I guess so, said Samuel.
Suffering—I wonder has it been properly looked at.
Tell me about your stick, Adam said.
How does it work?
Samuel stroked the fork now tied to his saddle strings.
I don’t really believe in it save that it works.
He smiled at Adam.
Maybe it’s this way.
Some people have a gift in this direction or that.
Does that make any sense to you?
I’d have to think about it, said Adam.
Can you stay the night?
I can but better not.
I didn’t tell Liza I’d be away the night.
I’d not like to give her a worry.
But she knows where you are.
Sure she knows.
But I’ll ride home tonight.
It doesn’t matter the time.
Now—as soon as you can.
You know it’s no cheap thing, indulging yourself with water.
It can run into money.
I have the money.
I want the wells.
 Samuel’ would be easier.
Remember my name is Adam.
Where will the orchard be?
Adam said, I won’t plant apples.
That would be looking for accidents.
What does Eve say to that?
She has a say, you remember.
And Eves delight in apples.
Not this one.
Adam’s eyes were shining.
You don’t know this Eve.
She’ll celebrate my choice.
I don’t think anyone can know her goodness.
You have a rarity.
Right now I can’t recall any greater gift.
Gift, Adam said softly.
You can’t know.
No one can know.
I had a gray life, Mr.
I don’t know why I tell you this.
Maybe because I like to hear.
My mother—died—before my memory.
My stepmother was a good woman but troubled and ill.
My father was a stern, fine man—maybe a great man.
You couldn’t love him?
I know—and some men want that.
He smiled ruefully.
I’ve always wanted the other.
Liza says it’s the weak thing in me.
You told me.
But you don’t think like a military man.
I wasn’t a good one.
I seem to be telling you everything.
You must want to.
There’s always a reason.
They rode on in silence for a time.
No, I have a brother.
Where is he—waiting for the picnic?
Yes—yes, that’s exactly what.
Then Cathy came.
I’ll want to hear, Samuel said.
I eat stories like grapes.
A kind of light spread out from her.
And everything changed color.
And the world opened out.
And a day was good to awaken to.
And there were no limits to anything.
And the people of the world were good and handsome.
And I was not afraid any more.
I recognize it, Samuel said.
That’s an old friend of mine.
Yes, that’s my acquaintance—eyes, nose, mouth, and hair.
All this coming out of a little hurt girl.
And not out of you?
Oh, no, or it would have come before.
No, Cathy brought it, and it lives around her.
And now I’ve told you why I want the wells.
I have to repay somehow for value received.
I can see my duty, he said.
What do you mean?
His voice grew strong with vehemence.
I should give you Othello’s handkerchief.
Oh, I know I should.
Are you joking?
It is the duty of a friend.
But I’m a false friend.
I’ll get no credit for it among my peers.
It’s a lovely thing, preserve it, and glory in it.
I’ll squeeze water out like juice from an orange.
They rode under the great oaks and toward the house.
Adam said, There she is, sitting outside.
He shouted, Cathy, he says there’s water—lots of it.
Even at this distance she looks beautiful, Samuel said.
Adam held her chair for her.
You haven’t met Mr.
Hamilton, dear, he said.
She held out her hand.
How do you do, she said.
Samuel had been inspecting her.
You are well, I hope?
Yes, I’m well.
The men sat down.
She makes it formal whether she wants to or not.
Every meal is a kind of occasion, Adam said.
Don’t talk like that, she said.
It isn’t true.
Doesn’t it feel like a party to you, Samuel?
And my children—they’re worse.
My boy Tom wanted to come today.
He’s spoiling to get off the ranch.
He paused, and the silence dropped.
Her wide-set eyes communicated nothing.
It isn’t cold, is it?
A goose walked over my grave, I guess.
Oh, yes, I know that feeling.
The silence fell again.
Do you like our valley, Mrs.
In about six weeks, Adam said.
Whatever was strange was not strange to Adam.
His face had happiness on it.
Samuel had never seen anyone chew that way before.
Samuel’s mind repeated, Something—something—can’t find what it is.
Something wrong, and the silence hung on the table.
There was a shuffle behind him.
Lee set a teapot on the table and shuffled away.
Samuel began to talk to push the silence away.
He threw in two sentences of nonsense.
There was no response from either Adam or Cathy.
He gave up.
Ma’am, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll ride off home.
And I thank you for your hospitality.
Good night, she said.
Don’t go now.
I hoped to persuade you to stay the night.
No, thank you, but that I can’t.
And it’s not a long ride.
I think—of course, I know—there’ll be a moon.
When will you start the wells?
In a few days I’ll send the equipment with Tom.
The life was flowing back into Adam.
Make it soon, he said.
I want it soon.
There’ll be nothing like it anywhere.
Samuel switched his gaze to Cathy’s face.
It did not change.
That will be nice, she said.
He shivered again.
Good night, then.
I’ll walk down with you.
No, stay with your wife.
You haven’t finished your supper.
Sit down, man.
Samuel pushed Adam gently down in his chair.
Good night, ma’am.
He walked quickly toward the shed.
The halter chain clinked against wood.
When you come back?
the Chinese asked softly.
I don’t know.
In a few days or a week.
Lee, what is it?
What is what?
By God, I got creepy!
Is there something wrong here?
What do you mean?
You know damn well what I mean.
Chinee boy jus’ workee—not hear, not talkee.
I guess you’re right.
Sure, you’re right.
Sorry I asked you.
It wasn’t very good manners.
He slipped the halter and dropped it in the manger.
Good night, Lee, he said.
Do you need a cook?
On my place I can’t afford a cook?
I’d work cheap.
Liza would kill you.
Why—you want to quit?
Just thought I’d ask, said Lee.
He’s a good man, Adam said.
I like him.
Yes, I know.
And it’s the poorest land you ever saw.
He could make more at wages from me.
I’ll ask him.
I used to know from what quarter the rains came.
It’s different here.
But I’ll learn.
It just takes a little time.
Are you comfortable, Cathy?
I might try lichee nuts from China.
I wonder if they would grow here.
Well, I can try.
Maybe Lee could tell me.
You haven’t really seen it.
Did I tell you?
He stretched his legs out comfortably under the table.
Lee should bring candles, he said.
I wonder what’s keeping him.
Cathy spoke very quietly.
Adam, I didn’t want to come here.
I am not going to stay here.
As soon as I can I will go away.
But I got over it.
We all get over it.
So don’t say silly things like that.
It’s not a silly thing.
Don’t talk about it, dear.
Everything will change after the baby is born.
He had hung his black hat on his saddle horn.
He looked in himself for envy and could find none.
His loins and his thighs had forgotten hunger.
When had the Welshrats started crawling in his chest?
But what about her?
She was silent, but many women were silent.
What was it?
Where had it come from?
Were they cold?
Was it her eyes?
He was circling to the point.
There was nothing recognizable behind them.
They were not human eyes.
They reminded him of something—what was it?
memory, some picture.
It’s no thing for anybody, but less for a child.
Let us out.
Please let us out.
I’ve a child here.
The wave was faceless and it pushed without passion.
Samuel raised his head to look at the structure.
The golden man seemed to have no arms.
The picture was clear, lighted and perfect.
Struggle as he would, he could not move his head.
He heard heartbeats in his hears.
I’d never have brought you if I’d known.
I didn’t see any, Samuel piped.
You held my head down.
I’m glad of that.
What was it?
I’ll have to tell you.
They were killing a bad man.
Was it the golden man?
Yes, it was.
And you must put no sorrow on him.
He had to be killed.
I saw the golden man.
He looked right down at me.
For that even more I thank God he’s gone.
What did he do?
I’ll never tell you nightmare things.
He had the strangest eyes, the golden man.
They put me in mind of a goat’s eyes.
And the shiny box with a picture into it?
There it was, mined out of the dusty past.
It was the eyes, of course, Samuel thought.
And he thought, It’s the night and the moon.
This is how we can get trapped.
Now think hard and then lose it.
Some accident of eye shape and eye color, it is.
But no, that’s not it.
Well, why is a look evil then?
Now, stop this romancing and never let it trouble again—ever.
Liza had been up before dawn.
She always was.
There was no possible virtue in either.
Only Tom and Joe lived on the ranch now.
A cheerful brown, they were, with tracings of darker brown.
Rolled-up sleeves at the table were not acceptable to Mrs.
I’m late, Mother, Samuel said.
She did not look around at him.
What time was it you came home?
Oh, it was late—late.
Must have been near eleven.
I didn’t look, fearing to waken you.
I did not waken, Liza said grimly.
How does the Sanchez place look?
Good morning, Mother.
Give me your blessing.
Bless you, said Liza automatically.
Trask is making great changes.
He’s fitting up the old house to live in.
Liza turned sharply from the stove.
Oh, he’s ripped out the floors and window casings.
All new and new painted.
When the paint dries you’ll smell pig, she said.
Not that I don’t like a rose myself.
Tom finished his hot cakes and stirred his coffee.
What kind of a man is he, Father?
Hear now the pot blackguarding the kettle, Liza interrupted.
I know, Mother, I know.
What’s his wife like?
Well, she’s very young and very pretty.
I know that, Liza said.
What was her name before?
I don’t know.
Well, where did she come from?
I don’t know.
What did you learn then?
How does she dress?
You’ve an eye for that.
Would you say they were made clothes or store bought?
Oh, I think store bought.
You would not know, Liza said firmly.
Dessie’s the clever love, said Samuel.
A needle sings in her hands.
She told me, Samuel said.
She’d make a great success of it.
Liza put her hands on her hips.
Dessie didn’t tell me.
She might have told me, said Liza.
I don’t like surprises.
Well, go on—what was she doing?
Trask of course.
Why, sitting, sitting in a chair under an oak tree.
Her time’s not far.
Samuel searched his memory.
Nothing I guess.
Not sewing, not mending, not knitting?
Samuel raised his head and laughed with pleasure.
It’s only the riches I’ll be going there for, Liza.
Is it all talk?
Is it a windmill turned by water?
We could buy a valley farm with your promises.
Adam Trask will pay, said Samuel.
He’s well fixed.
His father left him a fortune.
It’s a whole winter of work, Mother.
He’ll pay fifty cents a foot, and the windmills, Mother.
I can make everything but the casings right here.
I’ll need the boys to help.
I want to take Tom and Joe.
Joe can’t go, she said.
You know he’s delicate.
I thought I might scrape off some of his delicacy.
He can starve on delicacy.
Joe can’t go, she said finally.
I thought I’d ask George to come back.
Samuel said, Offhand I’d say I’m against it, Joe.
Your mother needs you here.
But I want to go, Father.
And that’s going away, isn’t it?
Please let me go.
I’ll work hard.
I’m sure you would if you could come.
But I’m against it.
You might even throw in that I refused you.
Joe grinned, and Tom laughed aloud.
Will you let her persuade you?
Samuel scowled at his sons.
I’m a hard-opinioned man, he said.
Once I’ve set my mind, oxen can’t stir me.
I’ll go in and talk to her now, said Joe.
Now, son, take it easy, Samuel called after him.
Use your head.
Let her do most of it.
Meanwhile I’ll set my stubborn up.
Her life may have been her language, formal, developed, indecipherable.
But the great lump was local.
Shoulders, neck, arms, hands, face, were unaffected, slender and girlish.
A woman gave a tooth for a child.
It was the law.
Cathy’s odd appetite was simple compared to some.
Again and again the scored hunks disappeared.
Cathy stole them and broke them in little pieces.
She spoke very little.
Her eyes were remote.
Activity surged around her.
Adam went happily about building and planning his Eden.
The Hamiltons moved their rig and started another hole.
It had a variable pitch and was an unheard-of thing.
It was a good time for Adam, the best time.
He was the king of his wide and spacious life.
And summer passed into a hot and fragrant autumn.
Take a look at it, son.
What do you think it is?
Tom studied the fragments in his hand.
Whatever it is, it’s hard, he said.
Couldn’t be a diamond that big.
Looks like metal.
Do you think we’ve bored into a buried locomotive?
His father laughed.
Thirty feet down, he said admiringly.
It looks like tool steel, said Tom.
We haven’t got anything that can touch it.
Then the world was peopled with wonders.
Samuel said, Metal, you say.
You think, steel.
Now hear my guess—and remember it.
How I would like to dig it up!
It’s in sea sand.
That’s what we’ve been getting.
It’s a lonely, lovely thing to think about, isn’t it?
He made them see it as he always did.
Tom said softly, You think it’s a meteorite, don’t you?
That I do.
and we can prove it by assay.
Joe said eagerly, Let’s dig it up.
You dig it, Joe, while we bore for water.
You’re my own son, said Samuel.
But we could probe down and see.
Why, what do you mean?
Now, Tom, have you no kindness toward your mother?
We give her enough trouble, son.
Have pity on her!
She’s a truthful woman, your mother.
She’d have to say, They’re at digging up a star.
 He laughed happily.
She’d never live it down.
And she’d make us smart.
No pies for three months.
Tom said, We can’t get through it.
We’ll have to move to another place.
He stood up.
That way she’ll dissemble her pleasure.
Joe said, Somebody’s coming, coming fast.
He pulled up, breathing heavily.
Missy Adam say come!
Missy Cathy bad—come quick.
Missy yell, scream.
Samuel said, Hold on, Lee.
When did it start?
Mebbe bleakfus time.
How is Adam?
Missy Adam clazy.
Sure, said Samuel.
These new fathers.
I was one once.
Tom, throw a saddle on for me, will you?
Joe said, What is it?
Trask is about to have her baby.
I told Adam I’d stand by.
Samuel leveled his eyes on his youngest son.
I brought both of you into the world, he said.
Tom, you get all the tools gathered up.
And go back to the ranch and sharpen the metal.
Joe said plaintively, But what will I do here alone?
Samuel was silent for a moment.
Then he said, Joe, do you love me?
What are you talking about?
All right then.
No relative to the train robber.
Tom led a saddled horse to him.
Can I read it next?
Come on, Lee.
Take it easy, Lee.
Birthing takes longer than you think, mostly.
I have the condensed form, in one volume, the textbook.
You could have borrowed it.
Have you now?
Do you have many books?
Not many here—thirty or forty.
But you’re welcome to any of them you haven’t read.
Thank you, Lee.
You know, you could talk to my boys.
It’s a hard bridge to cross, Mr.
Samuel said, Tell me, how is it with the mother?
Yes, I know.
But I’m not lonely and I’m on a tangent too.
But maybe not the same one.
You don’t think I imagine it then?
I’ll tell you how far it got with me though.
We Chinese have a well-developed demonology.
You think she is a demon?
Of course not, said Lee.
I hope I’m a little beyond such silliness.
I don’t know what it is.
You know, Mr.
And there’s a strangeness here.
Maybe that’s what makes me remember my father’s demons.
Did your father believe in them?
He thought I should know the background.
You Occidentals perpetuate a good many myths too.
Samuel said, Tell me what happened to set you off.
This morning, I mean.
If you weren’t coming I would try, said Lee.
But I would rather not.
You can see for yourself.
I may be crazy.
Of course Mr.
Give me a little hint.
It might save time.
What did she do?
That’s just it.
It’s—well—I’ll tell you the one thing I can think of.
It’s a strange day, and I don’t know why.
No wind, said Lee.
What a beautiful day to be born in!
Stay close, will you?
In case I need something.
Look, the men, the carpenters, are sitting under that tree.
Adam stopped the work.
He thought the hammering might disturb his wife.
Samuel said, You stay close.
That sounds like Adam playing true.
The workmen sitting under the tree waved to him.
How do, Mr.
How’s your family?
Say, isn’t that Rabbit Holman?
Where’ve you been, Rabbit?
Went prospecting, Mr.
Find anything, Rabbit?
They rode on toward the house.
What is it, Lee?
I’m not sure it can be done.
Will you take a look?
I’d like to, Lee.
Why, that would be a treat for me.
He knocked and got no answer and went in.
Samuel tapped lightly on the bedroom door and went in.
He raised his head and looked blindly out.
Samuel said pleasantly, Why are you sitting in the dark?
Adam’s voice was hoarse.
She doesn’t want the light.
It hurts her eyes.
There will have to be lieht, he said.
She can close her eyes.
I’ll tie a black cloth over them if she wants.
The light hurts her, he said fiercely.
Samuel turned on him.
Now, Adam, I know what you feel.
I only hope one of those things isn’t you.
Close your eyes, dear.
I’ll put a cloth over your eyes.
No, I can’t.
Because I don’t want you in the way.
It’s considered a sweet practice for you to get drunk.
You wait for me to come out.
He’s an upset, vehement man, he said.
He loves you.
He had not looked at her closely until now.
It’ll be over before long, dearie.
Now tell me, has the water broke?
She did not answer him.
He stared at her.
It’s not a pleasure to me, young woman.
Maybe I can save you some pain—who knows?
I’m going to ask you one more question.
She made a great effort.
Her face became young and innocent and bravely hurt.
She said softly, The water broke at dawn.
Have you had hard labor?
How far apart?
I don’t know.
Well, I’ve been in this room fifteen minutes.
I’ve had two little ones—no big ones since you came.
Now where’s your linen?
In that hamper over there.
You’ll be all right, dearie, he said gently.
On the velvet hundreds of little pink flowers were embroidered.
Liza sent you her pulling rope to use, he said.
She made it when our first-born was preparing.
But there was no scream—only a series of grunting squeals.
The labor struck again.
There’s a dear, he said soothingly.
Was it one or two?
I don’t know.
I’d better get my hands washed.
Her head threshed from side to side.
Good, good, my darling, he said.
I think it won’t be long till your baby’s here.
How did you get the hurt on your head?
A shrill snarling came from her set teeth.
The flesh was torn and bleeding.
He looked at her with fear.
I’m sorry, she said quickly.
Oh, I’m sorry.
It was the pain, she said.
Samuel laughed shortly.
I’ll have to muzzle you, I guess, he said.
A collie bitch did the same to me once.
Samuel said, Have you got anything to put on it?
Humans are more poisonous than snakes.
I don’t know.
Well, have you got any whisky?
I’ll pour some whisky on it.
In the second drawer.
He took a swallow of whisky to steady himself.
He dreaded to look back at the bed.
Samuel told Adam afterward, She must be made of whalebone.
The birth happened before I was ready.
Popped like a seed.
I’d not the water ready to wash him.
Pure whalebone, she is.
Adam came charging into the room.
You’ve got a boy!
Samuel said, Send Lee in here.
And see the lamps are filled and the chimneys clean.
Adam turned like a zombie and left the room.
In a moment Lee looked in.
Samuel pointed to the bundle in a laundry basket.
Sponge him off in warm water, Lee.
Don’t let a draft get on him.
I wish Liza were here.
I can’t do everything at once.
He turned back to the bed.
Now, dearie, I’ll get you cleaned up.
Cathy was bowed again, snarling in her pain.
It’ll be over in a little, he said.
Takes a little time for the residue.
And you’re so quick.
Why, you didn’t even have to pull on Liza’s rope.
He saw something, stared, and went quickly to work.
Lord God in Heaven, it’s another one!
And again Samuel tied the cord.
At last he had to look at her.
It was stony, expressionless.
At her throat the pulse fluttered visibly.
You have two sons, Samuel said.
Two fine sons.
They aren’t alike.
Each one born separate in his own sack.
She inspected him coldly and without interest.
Samuel said, I’ll show your boys to you.
No, she said without emphasis.
Now, dearie, don’t you want to see your sons?
I don’t want them.
Oh, you’ll change.
You’re tired now, but you’ll change.
The eyes moved from his face.
I don’t want them.
Take them out of the room.
Send Adam in.
Samuel was caught by her tone.
There was no sickness, no weariness, no softness.
His words came out without his will.
But his words had no effect on Cathy.
Send Adam in, she said.
In a moment came the sound of tapping.
Adam was nailing the blankets over the windows again.
Lee brought coffee to Samuel.
That’s a bad-looking hand you have there, he said.
I’m afraid it’s going to give me trouble.
Why did she do it?
I don’t know.
She’s a strange thing.
Lee said, Mr.
Hamilton, let me take care of that.
You could lose an arm.
The life went out of Samuel.
Do what you want, Lee.
A frightened sorrow has closed down over my heart.
I wish I were a child so I could cry.
I’m too old to be afraid like this.
It will hurt, he said softly.
I’ll try to bear it, Lee.
It’s mostly carbolic acid, Lee said.
You can smell it.
Thank you, Lee.
I’m being a baby to knot up like this.
I’ll get you another cup of coffee.
I think I’ll go away, he said.
I never went willingly to a slaughter house.
What do you mean?
I don’t know.
The words came out.
Lee, men are fools.
What made you doubt it?
What do you want to say?
What do you want to say?
Lee repeated patiently.
I feel wings over this house.
I feel a dreadfulness coming.
I feel it too.
And I fear for these kittens.
I have dreadful thoughts gnawing to get into my brain.
What do you want to say?
Lee asked a third time.
I want my wife, Samuel cried.
No dreams, no ghosts, no foolishness.
I want her here.
Liza has no truck with foolishness.
If Liza feels trouble we’ll bar the doors.
They’re sleeping, he said.
They’ll be squalling soon enough.
Tell her I need her here.
If Tom’s still there, tell him to mind the place.
If not, I’ll send him in the morning.
She’ll know what you mean.
I’ll do it, said Lee.
I’ve thought of that, Samuel said.
Do not, for God’s sake, tell her how it happened.
It will be a great relief to have her here.
That it will, Lee.
That it will.
She’ll let some light into this cellar hole.
Cathy’s voice came strong and edged from the bed.
Shut the door.
I do not want the light.
Adam, go out!
I want to be in the dark—alone.
Adam said hoarsely, I want to stay with you.
I do not want you.
I will stay.
But don’t talk any more.
Please close the door and take the lamp away.
Samuel went back to the living room.
Samuel put his forefinger down and stroked the hot foreheads.
The night was very dark.
How is she?
Who is it?
It’s me, Rabbit.
The mother, Rabbit?
Oh, she’s fine.
Lee said twins.
That’s right—twin sons.
You couldn’t want better.
I guess Mr.
Trask will tear the river up by the roots now.
He’ll bring in a crop of candy canes.
Samuel didn’t know why he changed the subject.
Rabbit, do you know what we bored into today?
What’s that, Mr.
A shooting star that fell a million years ago.
Well, think of that!
How did you hurt your hand?
I almost said on a shooting star.
But it wasn’t that interesting.
I pinched it in the tackle.
No, not bad.
Two boys, said Rabbit.
My old lady will be jealous.
Will you come inside and sit, Rabbit?
No, no, thank you.
I’ll get out to sleep.
Morning seems to come earlier every year I live.
That it does, Rabbit.
Good night then.
Liza Hamilton arrived about four in the morning.
If Samuel craved realism and activity, he got it.
She had him off the place by dawn.
Liza stayed away a week.
Adam she ignored since she couldn’t use him for anything.
And just as well too, she said.
Samuel asked questions of her in flight.
How were the babies?
They were fine, growing.
How was Adam?
How was Mrs.
And it’s a strange thing, Liza said.
Maybe it’s that scar.
How did she get it?
I don’t know, said Samuel.
Liza leveled her forefinger like a pistol between his eyes.
I’ll tell you something.
Unbeknownst to herself, she’s put a spell on her husband.
He moons around her like a sick duck.
Samuel waited until she went by again.
Twin boys take a piece of looking after.
Sure I know him.
Well, wouldn’t you say offhand he was a heathen?
I don’t know.
Come now, Samuel, anybody would.
But he’s not.
She straightened up.
What is he?
She tapped his arm with an iron finger.
Now what do you think of that?
And I say yes.
No wonder they’re taking on weight, said Samuel.
We’ll do it too, said Samuel.
For a week Cathy rested and gathered her strength.
Adam tried the door and found it locked.
I’m busy, she called, and he went away.
Well, do it then, said Adam.
She’s your mistress.
Missy say not come back mebbe Monday.
Cathy spoke calmly from the doorway.
He hasn’t had a day off for a long time.
A rest would do him good.
Of course, said Adam.
I just didn’t think of it.
Have a good time.
If I need anything I’ll get one of the carpenters.
Men go home, Sunday.
I’ll get the Indian.
Lopez will help.
Lee felt Cathy’s eyes on him.
Find bottle whisky.
Adam said petulantly, I’m not helpless, Lee.
Lee looked at Cathy standing in the doorway.
He lowered his eyelids.
He turned away.
Goo-by, he said.
At seven-thirty Adam knocked.
I’ve got you some supper, dear.
It’s not much.
The door opened as though she had been standing waiting.
Adam’s mouth dropped open.
She gave him no chance to speak.
I’m going away now.
Cathy, what do you mean?
I told you before.
You didn’t listen.
It doesn’t matter.
I don’t believe you.
Her voice was dead and metallic.
I don’t give a damn what you believe.
Throw them in one of your wells.
He cried in panic, Cathy, you’re sick.
You can’t go—not from me—not from me.
I can do anything to you.
Any woman can do anything to you.
You’re a fool.
The word got through his haze.
He could hear her moving quietly about.
His ear was almost touching the door.
He heard richness in her voice.
I’m sorry, Adam.
His breath burst hoarsely out of his throat.
He pushed the door open.
She stood three feet away.
In her right hand she held his .
She shot him.
He stared up into her eyes, which inspected him impersonally.
He had forgotten to feed them.
The sheriff was an important officer.
The Euskadis were well-to-do, handsome people of Basque extraction.
I heard it was pretty nice, run like San Francisco.
They’ve got a piano player.
Some other time, he said.
I’ve got to look into something.
You wouldn’t be going to Trask’s, would you?
Did you hear anything about it?
Not to make any sense.
I heard Mr.
I don’t know.
Them Easterners are pretty clever.
I thought I’d go up and find out.
Didn’t his wife just have a baby?
Twins, I heard, said Julius.
Maybe they shot him.
One hold the gun and the other pull the trigger?
Hear anything else?
All mixed up, Horace.
Want some company?
I’m not going to deputize you, Julius.
Sheriff says the supervisors are raising hell about the payroll.
No, I’m not.
And you get no star.
Hell, I don’t want to be a deputy.
Just thought I’d ride along with you for company.
Glad to have you, Julius.
What do you say the new place is called?
It was a nice day to be riding.
There was no sound, no movement.
Told them not to come back.
They say Trask has got a pot of money.
I guess he’s well fixed, all right, said Julius.
How is Mr.
I ought to go up to see him.
Full of hell as ever.
Lee came out on the stoop to meet them.
Horace said, Hello, Ching Chong.
Bossy man here?
He sick, said Lee.
I’d like to see him.
That’s enough of that, said Horace.
Tell him Deputy Sheriff Quinn wants to see him.
Lee disappeared, and in a moment he was back.
You come, he said, I take horsy.
The room reeked of Hall’s Cream Salve.
His bony right hand kneaded a fistful of coverlet.
Horace said, Howdy, Mr.
Heard you got hurt.
He paused, waiting for an answer.
How’d it happen?
A look of transparent eagerness came over Adam’s face.
He shifted slightly in the bed.
Only when I breathe deep, Adam said softly.
I was cleaning my gun and it went off.
Horace glanced at Julius and then back.
Happens all the time, said Horace.
Got the gun around?
I think Lee put it away.
Horace stepped to the door.
Hey there, Ching Chong, bring the pistol.
There’s better shooting cleaning the damn things than pointing them.
I’ll have to make a report to the county, Mr.
I won’t take up much of your time.
That’s right, sir, Adam said quickly.
And cleaning it, you hadn’t swung out the cylinder?
Adam’s breath rasped in a quick intake.
Horace’s pale sun-washed eyes never left Adam’s face.
He said kindly, What happened, Mr.
Tell me what happened.
I tell you truly it was an accident, sir.
The sheriff would think I was crazy.
Well, I’m not very used to guns.
There was a whistle in Horace’s nose.
He had to breathe through his mouth to stop it.
So you’d be more used to a shotgun?
But I never hunted much.
That’s right, Adam said eagerly.
Hardly anybody there has a pistol.
Horace sighed and looked away from Adam.
I haven’t got the guts for it.
It isn’t any fun to me.
Adam watched him nervously.
It’s a mean thing, makes me feel mean.
Julius said irritably, Get to it.
You can’t resign right this minute.
The hell I can’t—if I want to.
Trask, you served in the United States Cavalry.
The weapons of the cavalry are carbines and pistols.
You— He stopped and swallowed.
What happened, Mr.
It was an accident, he whispered.
Anybody see it?
Was your wife with you when it happened?
Trask, he said, I know you’re a sick man.
Lee did not reply.
Adam spoke without opening his eyes.
My wife is away on a visit.
She wasn’t here when it happened?
Horace thought quickly, He’s ahead of me.
He’d make a good sheriff.
Say, he said, that’s kind of interesting.
Did she take the babies with her?
I thought I heard them a little while ago.
I hate this, but I can’t stop now.
This isn’t nosiness.
This is the law.
My wife went away, he said.
Where did she go?
I don’t know.
What do you mean?
I don’t know where she went.
Julius broke in, speaking for the first time.
Why did she go?
I don’t know.
Horace said angrily, You watch it, Trask.
You must know why she went away.
I don’t know why she went.
Was she sick?
Did she act strange?
Ching Chong, do you know anything about this?
I go King City Satdy.
Come back mebbe twelve night.
Find Missy Tlask on floor.
So you weren’t here when it happened?
All right, Trask, I’ll have to get back to you.
There, that’s better.
Your wife went away.
Did she shoot you?
It was an accident.
It was an accident.
You don’t make it very easy.
a kid’s game.
You’re making it that way.
How long have you been married?
Nearly a year.
What was her name before you married her?
Now you watch it.
Where did she come from?
I don’t know.
Trask, you’re talking yourself right into the county jail.
Let’s have a description.
How tall was she?
Adam’s eyes gleamed.
Not tall—little and delicate.
That’s just fine.
What color hair?
She was beautiful.
Oh, God, no.
Yes—a scar on her forehead.
And you think I’m a fool.
Adam said, She had a secret.
I promised I wouldn’t ask her.
She was afraid for someone.
And without warning Adam began to cry.
It was hopeless crying.
Horace felt misery rising in him.
All right, Julius, tell me what you think.
Is he crazy?
I don’t know.
Did he kill her?
That’s what jumped into my mind.
Mine too, said Horace.
I forgot them, he apologized.
I won’t last long in this job.
Julius asked, What are you going to do?
Well, I think it’s beyond me.
I don’t want to get sworn in, Horace.
I want to go to Salinas.
You don’t have any choice, Julius.
My father will skin me alive.
All right, what do we do now?
Horace said, I’m going to run to papa.
I need the sheriff.
You’ve got to stay, Julius.
Have you got a gun?
Well, take this one, and take my star.
He unpinned it from his shirt and held it out.
How long do you think you’ll be gone?
Not any longer than I can help.
Did you ever see Mrs.
No, I didn’t.
Neither did I.
And she’s not very big and she is beautiful.
That’s one hell of a description!
Do you think he killed her?
How the hell do I know?
Don’t get mad.
You want an idea, Horace?
Don’t it look like I need one?
Well, Sam Hamilton knew her—he took the babies, Rabbit says.
Hamilton took care of her.
I think maybe you better keep that star, said Horace.
I’ll get going.
You want me to look around?
Take care of yourself.
Horace sat down at the table with him.
How are you, Will?
Oh, pretty good.
Up here on business?
Well, yes, I do have a little deal on.
You might let me in on something sometime.
Some people exude their futures, good or bad.
I’ll do that, Horace.
I thought the ranch took all your time.
Will leaned over the table.
Did you ever think of running for office?
What do you mean?
Why, no, I didn’t.
Well, you think about it.
Just keep it under your hat.
But keep it under your hat.
I’ll certainly do that, Will.
But we’ve got an awful good sheriff.
That’s got nothing to do with it.
King City hasn’t got a single county officer—you see?
I’ll think about it.
Will’s face lighted up.
How were they?
You know, your father is a real comical genius.
But he’s a smart man too, Will.
Oh, Lord, said Will, here come the patent attorneys again!
But this is good, said Horace.
They’re all good.
Drives my mother crazy.
I guess you’ve got a point there.
He took you in, did he, Horace?
I guess he did.
But you wouldn’t want him to change, would you?
Oh, Lord, no!
You think about what I said.
And keep it under your hat, said Will.
It was a complicated position.
And Monterey County had a good one.
He had a brilliant gift for minding his own business.
Well, there I was on a limb, Horace said.
I couldn’t find out what happened.
I couldn’t even find out what the woman looked like.
The sheriff stirred, crossed his legs, and inspected the job.
You think he killed her.
Well, I did.
Hamilton kind of talked me out of it.
Everybody’s got it in him, the sheriff said.
You just find his trigger and anybody will go off.
Hamilton told me some funny things about her.
Did Sam give you a description?
He did, and his wife did.
When Horace finished the sheriff sighed.
They both agreed about the scar?
Yes, they did.
Have a drink, he said.
Don’t mind if I do.
Here’s looking at you.
Horace wiped his mouth and handed back the pint.
Got any ideas?
We’ve got a pretty well-run county, he said.
My office gets along fine with the local people.
He looked Horace in the eye.
Don’t get restless.
I’m not making a speech.
I just want to tell you how it is.
We don’t drive people.
We’ve got to live with them.
Did I do something wrong?
No, you didn’t, Horace.
You did just right.
Now hold on.
I’m listening, said Horace.
I know that.
Everybody knows it.
If we closed them up they’d just move.
The people want those houses.
Now wait a minute.
Came from Sacramento.
Ran a place there.
A pretty damn good citizen.
Julius told me.
Name of Faye.
Well, she opened a nice place, quiet, well run.
It’s about time they had some competition.
There’s a piano player.
Yes, there is.
Good one too—blind fella.
Say, are you going to let me tell this?
I’m sorry, said Horace.
That’s all right.
I know I’m slow but I’m thorough.
Horace said softly.
Now don’t get ahead of me.
I hate to tell something you already thought out.
Faye sent me a note Sunday night.
She knows all the answers and all the tricks.
I went down and looked her over.
She’s of age and nobody’s made a complaint.
He spread his hands.
Well, there it is.
What do we do about it?
You’re pretty sure it’s Mrs.
Adam’s weeping face was in Horace’s mind.
God all mighty!
Sheriff, you got to get somebody else to tell him.
I’ll quit before I do.
The sheriff gazed into space.
She really bullshitted him, didn’t she?
The poor bastard, Horace said.
The poor bastard is in love with her.
No, by God, somebody else has got to tell him.
The sheriff stood up.
They walked along the street in silence for a while.
I guess that’s right.
You said she had twins?
Yeah, twin boys.
You listen to me, Horace.
Adam sat in his chair under the big oak tree.
Lee came out carrying the laundry basket.
Adam leaned over and picked it out.
Adam’s voice had gone rusty from lack of use.
No, he said, I don’t want any wells.
I’ll pay for the work you did.
I don’t want advice.
It’s a giver’s present.
Go through the motions, Adam.
Act out being alive, like a play.
Why should I?
Samuel was looking at the twins.
Something will grow.
Adam did not answer, and Samuel stood up.
I’ll be back, he said.
I’ll be back again and again.
Go through the motions, Adam.
There goes your bookstore, Lee, he said.
A new country seems to follow a pattern.
First come the openers, strong and brave and rather childlike.
And culture can be on any level, and is.
They fought at the turn of a doctrine.
And they brought conscience, or, rather, nudged the dozing conscience.
And it doesn’t matter much that his motive was impure.
He used good material and some of it stuck.
I use Billing only as an outrageous example.
The honest preachers had energy and go.
The sects did more than this, though.
The brothels were quiet, orderly, and circumspect.
The brothel was accepted while it was not admitted.
You walked west on Main Street until it bent.
That’s where Castroville Street crossed Main.
Castroville Street is now called Market Street, God knows why.
Anyway, when you came to Castroville Street you turned right.
If you turned right you were on the Row.
Do you remember hearing that, old men?
Remember, too, the little houses, unpainted, unrepaired?
You could hear only a murmur from within.
There is something very attractive to men about a madam.
Myths collect around her, and, oddly enough, not voluptuous myths.
It was no jump in the hay.
Faye was the motherly type, big-breasted, big-hipped, and warm.
Faye was the reassurer of misbegotten husbands.
Her house took up the slack for frigid wives.
It was the cinnamon-scented kitchen of one’s grandmother.
People trusted her and she trusted everyone.
She was no competition to the others.
She was a third phase.
Faye contributed heavily to every charity.
She could tick them off—lazy, vengeful, lustful, unsatisfied, greedy, ambitious.
Kate didn’t fall into any of these classes.
It just seems so strange that you should come here.
Kate smiled shyly.
It’s so hard to explain.
I hope you won’t insist on knowing.
Please don’t ask me.
Faye nodded solemnly.
I’ve known things like that.
I’d cut out my tongue before I’d tell.
Do you have a baby, dear?
That’s all right.
That’s all right.
You just take your time.
Faye was not bright, but she was far from stupid.
She went to the sheriff and got herself cleared.
There was no sense in taking chances.
Kate might have been a chiseler, but she wasn’t.
She went to work right away.
A pretty face won’t do that.
and second, will she get along with the other girls?
There’s nothing will upset a house like an ill-tempered girl.
Faye didn’t have long to wonder about the second question.
Kate put herself out to be pleasant.
She helped the other girls keep their rooms clean.
You couldn’t want a better girl.
She became best friend to everyone in the house.
She soon had her own group of regular customers.
Kate was thoughtful too.
Faye realized she had a treasure.
But it’s not like that at all.
You have to feed the girls—that’s groceries and a cook.
Faye didn’t see how she ever got along without Kate.
She could make beautiful initials.
Nearly all the girls carried and treasured her handkerchiefs.
Gradually a perfectly natural thing happened.
She did not want her daughter to be a whore.
It was a perfectly reasonable sequence.
It was a problem.
It was Faye’s nature to approach any subject sideways.
How the time goes!
Quicker as you get older, I think.
He was nearly an hour with you.
He didn’t—but of course not.
He’s a family man.
He goes to Jenny’s.
But I don’t want to pry into your affairs.
There’s no secret at all about that, said Kate.
I would have told you.
He told me I should go home.
He was very nice about it.
Did you tell him why?
Faye asked jealously.
Of course not.
Don’t be silly, darling.
You’re such a funny little girl.
Faye smiled and snuggled contentedly down in her chair.
As a matter of fact, she rather liked the sheriff.
He was direct.
Maybe that was what impressed her.
He neither looked in her eyes nor avoided them.
I don’t want to make a record, he said quietly.
I’ve held office a long time.
About one more term will be enough.
He nodded his head slowly.
I don’t want to know, he said.
I hear he’s a very nice man.
I hear also that he’s pretty hard hit.
He looked into her eyes for a moment.
Don’t you want to know how bad you shot him?
Yes, she said.
That Chink is taking pretty good care of him.
A forty-four tears hell out of a man.
I’m sorry, she said quietly.
The sheriff’s eyes became alert.
You’re not sorry.
We used to do that here.
That’s a funny picture for a whorehouse, he said.
It was here, said Kate.
Apparently the preliminaries were over now.
Even his buttocks pulled in a little.
You left a couple of babies, he said.
Now you calm down.
I think I know you.
But I don’t want to do that.
A whore is a whore.
Kate asked evenly, What is it you do want?
That’s more like it, the sheriff said.
Here’s what I want.
I notice you changed your name.
I want you to keep your new name.
She was smiling a little, and not a forced smile.
One thing I thought of, he said.
Did you know many people around King City?
I heard about the knitting needle, he said casually.
That your real hair color?
Dye it black for a while.
Lots of people look like somebody else.
How about this?
She touched her scar with a slender finger.
Well, that’s just a—what is that word?
What is that goddam word?
I had it this morning.
He seemed to be finished.
His cigarette burned crookedly up the side.
Kate said, Isn’t there a threat?
No, there isn’t.
Trask or his boys.
He stood up and went to the door, then turned.
Everybody likes him.
I don’t want him in here.
I’ll tell Faye too.
Let him go to Jenny’s.
He closed the door behind him.
Kate smiled down at her fingers.
I said it then and I say it again.
I liked your hair blond better.
I don’t know what got into you to change it.
You’ve got a fair complexion.
She was very clever.
She told the best lie of all—the truth.
I didn’t want to tell you, she said.
What a good child it is, she said.
What a thoughtful dear.
Kate said, Let’s have some tea.
I’ll bring it in.
Blue lights of pain flashed through her.
Her forehead became wet.
What is it?
Here, let me see.
Open and point.
There it is.
Only that big?
It felt like a house.
Bring the paregoric and a piece of cotton.
Will you help me pack this tooth?
You ought to have it out.
I have three teeth missing on this side.
Well, you’d never know it.
That made me feel all shaky.
Bring me the Pinkham, will you?
That’s a wonderful medicine, she said.
The woman who invented it was a saint.
It was a pleasant afternoon.
The cook was fighting pots in the kitchen.
Come in, Cotton Eye, Faye called.
What is it you want?
He turned to her.
I don’t feel good, Miss Faye.
You were sick two nights last week, Cotton Eye.
Don’t you like your job?
I don’t feel good.
Well, all right.
But I wish you’d take better care of yourself.
Oh, Miss Kate.
I didn’t know you was here.
I ain’t been smoking.
You’ve been smoking, Kate said.
Yes, Miss Kate, I sure will let it alone.
I don’t feel good.
Faye said, He told me he’d stopped.
He hasn’t stopped.
Kate stood in front of her.
You’re so sweet, she said.
You believe in everybody.
Who’d want to steal from me?
Kate put her hand on Faye’s plump shoulders.
Not everyone is as nice as you are.
Faye’s eyes glistened with tears.
You’re like my own daughter, Kate, she said.
I’m beginning to believe I am.
I never knew my mother.
She died when I was small.
Faye drew a deep breath and plunged into the subject.
Kate, I don’t like you working here.
Faye shook her head, trying to find words.
I’m not ashamed.
I run a nice house.
If I didn’t somebody else might run a bad house.
I don’t do anybody any harm.
I’m not ashamed.
Why should you be?
But I don’t like you working.
I just don’t like it.
You’re sort of my daughter.
I don’t like my daughter working.
Don’t be a silly, darling, said Kate.
I have to—here or somewhere else.
I told you.
I have to have the money.
No, you don’t.
Of course I do.
Where else could I get it?
You could be my daughter.
You could manage the house.
I’m not always well, you know.
I know you’re not, poor darling.
But I have to have money.
There’s plenty for both of us, Kate.
Kate shook her head sadly.
I do love you, she said.
And I wish I could do what you want.
No, I must go on working.
Do you know, dear, I have five regulars tonight?
A jar of shock struck Faye.
I don’t want you to work.
I have to, Mother.
The word did it.
The outburst sniffled to a close.
The dusk was settling deeply on the valley.
Now you’re all right.
Kate, can’t you tell your regulars you’re sick?
Of course not, Mother.
Kate, it’s Wednesday.
Probably won’t be anybody in after one o’clock.
The Woodmen of the World are having a do.
But on Wednesday—the Woodmen won’t be here after two.
What are you getting at?
Kate, when you close, you tap on my door.
I’ll have a little surprise for you.
What kind of a surprise?
Oh, a secret surprise!
Sounds like a cake surprise.
Now don’t ask questions, darling.
It’s a surprise.
Kate kissed her.
What a dear you are, Mother.
Her fingers caressed her little pointed chin.
Her eyes were calm.
What kept the Woodmen away was a sad accident.
Nobody felt like sitting down to the doughnut supper.
Ethel had said.
I never heard it so quiet.
No music, cat’s got Kate’s tongue.
It’s like setting up with a corpse.
Grace had said, I wonder what cat’s got Kate’s tongue.
Don’t you feel good?
Kate—I said, don’t you feel good?
I guess I was thinking of something.
Well, I’m not, said Grace.
Why don’t we close up?
Let’s ask Faye if we can’t lock up.
There won’t even be a Chink in tonight.
I’m going to ask Faye.
Kate’s voice cut in on her.
Let Faye alone.
She’s not well.
We’ll close up at two.
That clock’s way wrong, said Ethel.
What’s the matter with Faye?
Kate said, Maybe that’s what I was thinking about.
Faye’s not well.
I’m worried to death about her.
She won’t show it if she can help it.
I thought she was all right, Grace said.
Ethel hit the jackpot again.
Well, she don’t look good to me.
She’s got a kind of flush.
I noticed it.
Kate spoke very softly.
Don’t you girls ever let her know I told you.
She wouldn’t want you to worry.
What a dear she is!
Best goddam house I ever hustled, said Grace.
She knows all the words.
She don’t like to hear them—not from us.
Kate said patiently, I want to tell you what happened.
I do wish she’d see a doctor.
That clock’s way wrong but I forget which way.
Kate said, You girls go on to bed.
I’ll lock up.
She patted her cheeks with Florida water.
Kate tapped softly.
Faye called, Who is it?
Don’t you come in yet.
You wait outside.
I’ll tell you when.
Kate heard a rustling and a scratching in the room.
Then Faye called, All right.
The room was decorated.
What in the world?
She closed the door.
Why, it looks like a party!
It is a party.
It’s a party for my dear daughter.
It’s not my birthday.
Faye said, In a way maybe it is.
I don’t know what you mean.
But I brought you a present.
She laid the folded handkerchief in Faye’s lap.
Open it carefully, she said.
Faye held the watch up.
Oh, my dear, my dear!
You crazy child!
No, I can’t take it.
It was engraved.
with all my heart from A.
It was my mother’s watch, Kate said softly.
I would like my new mother to have it.
My darling child!
My darling child!
Mother would be glad.
But it’s my party.
I want it to be fancy.
She raised her glass.
To my new daughter—may you have long life and happiness.
And when they had drunk Kate proposed, To my mother.
Faye said, You’ll make me cry—don’t make me cry.
Over on the bureau, dear.
Bring the little mahogany box.
There that’s the one.
Now put it on the table here and open it.
What in the world is it?
It’s my gift to you.
It was simple, direct, and legally irreproachable.
Faye watched her, and her lips were parted in expectation.
When Kate’s lips moved, reading, Faye’s lips moved.
She sat in her chair.
Faye said at last, Are you pleased?
Kate said quietly, I’m trying to hold on, Mother.
I didn’t know anyone could be so good.
Faye said, It’s a funny present, isn’t it?
No, it isn’t funny.
I mean, a will is a strange present.
But it means more than that.
Now you are my real daughter I can tell you.
In my desk are notations of accounts and safe-deposit boxes.
Why are you so silent, child?
Is something bothering you?
A will sounds like death.
That’s thrown a pall.
But everyone should make a will.
I know, Mother.
Kate smiled ruefully.
A thought crossed my mind.
You can’t do this.
My poor little girl, is that what’s bothering you?
I have no folks.
As far as I know I have no kin.
And if I did have some—who would know?
Do you think you are the only one with secrets?
Kate looked long and levelly at Faye.
Kate, she cried, Kate, it’s a party.
Don’t be sad!
Don’t be frozen!
She put her cheek on Faye’s knee.
Shyly Faye’s fingers explored to the borders of the scar.
I think I’ve never been so happy before, said Kate.
You make me happy too.
Happier than I have ever been.
Now I don’t feel alone.
Now I feel safe.
Kate picked delicately at the gold thread with her fingernails.
Kate, she said, we’re forgetting.
It’s a party.
We’ve forgotten the wine.
Pour it, child.
We’ll have a little celebration.
Kate said uneasily, Do we need it, Mother?
I like to take on a little load.
It lets the poison out.
Don’t you like champagne, Kate?
Pour it, darling.
Kate got up from the floor and filled the glasses.
Faye said, Now drink it down.
I’m watching you.
You’re not an old woman, Mother.
Don’t talk—drink it.
I won’t touch mine until yours is empty.
Good, that’s good, she said.
Fill them up.
Now, come on dear—down the rat hole.
After two or three the bad things go away.
Kate’s chemistry screamed against the wine.
She remembered, and she was afraid.
Faye said, Now let me see the bottom, child—there.
You see how good it is?
Fill up again.
Her fear evaporated, her fear of anything disappeared.
Her voice became chill and her mouth was thin.
Her wide-set eyes slitted and grew watchful and sardonic.
Now you drink—Mother—while I watch, she said.
I’ll bet you can’t drink two without stopping.
Don’t bet me, Kate.
I can drink six without stopping.
Let me see you.
If I do, will you?
Kate said, I could tell stories nobody would believe.
Don’t be silly.
You’re a child.
You never saw such a child.
This is a child—yes—a child!
She laughed with a thin penetrating shriek.
The sound got through the wine that was muffling Faye.
She centered her eyes on Kate.
You look so strange, she said.
I guess it’s the lamplight.
You look different.
I am different.
Call me Mother,’ dear.
Kate, we’re going to have such a good life.
You bet we are.
You don’t even know.
You don’t know.
I’ve always wanted to go to Europe.
Maybe we’ll do that—but not now.
Why not, Kate?
I have plenty of money.
We’ll have plenty more.
Faye spoke pleadingly, Why don’t we go now?
We could sell the house.
What do you mean, no?
It’s my house.
I can sell it.
Did you forget I’m your daughter?
I don’t like your tone, Kate.
What’s the matter with you?
Is there any more wine?
Sure, there’s a little.
Look at it through the bottle.
Here, drink it out of the bottle.
That’s right—Mother—spill it down your neck.
Faye wailed, Kate, don’t be mean!
We were feeling so nice.
What do you want to go and spoil it for?
Kate wrenched the bottle from her hand.
Here, give me that.
Her face was sharp and her eyes glinted.
She laughed softly.
We’ll give them pleasure, Mother dear.
Faye said sharply.
Kate, you’re drunk.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
You don’t, Mother dear?
Do you want me to tell you?
I want you to be sweet.
I want you to be like you were.
Well, it’s too late.
I didn’t want to drink the wine.
But you, you nasty fat worm, you made me.
I’m your dear, sweet daughter—don’t you remember?
Do you think I’ll give them up?
They can’t go to anybody else.
Nobody else is any good for them.
Faye wept like a child.
Kate, she said, don’t talk like that.
You’re not like that.
You’re not like that.
Look at the heelmarks on the groin—very pretty.
And the little cuts that bleed for a long time.
Faye struggled to get out of her chair.
Kate pushed her back.
In her chair Faye began to scream hoarsely.
Don’t make a noise.
There’s a good darling.
Get snot all over your daughter’s hand—but no noise.
Faye whispered, I want you out of the house.
I want you out.
I run a good house without nastiness.
I want you out.
I can’t go, Mother.
I can’t leave you alone, poor dear.
Her voice chilled.
Now I’m sick of you.
Sick of you.
Here, Mother, drink it.
It will be good for you.
I don’t want to.
There’s a good dear.
She coaxed the fluid into Faye.
Now one more swallow—just one more.
She gripped her hands together, and the panic grew.
She retched and strained again and again.
Then she went back to Faye’s room.
Faye was still snoring in her chair.
The day was coming fast.
Kate’s eyes become alert.
Her eyes were wide and terrified.
Kate said, It’s all right, Mother.
It’s all right.
You had a nightmare.
You had a bad dream.
Kate put the bottle back in its drawer.
Kate moved quietly.
Kate acted slowly and precisely.
She picked up the handkerchief and smelled it.
This she did three times.
Faye was very near the surface now.
She whined and sniffled and tossed.
You’re having a bad dream.
Come out of the bad dream, Mother.
Faye’s breathing grew more regular.
She went quietly back to Faye’s room.
Faye was still sleeping peacefully on her side.
Kate opened the door to the hall.
Faye screamed, and screamed again.
Now don’t go in there, Miss Kate.
You don’t know what’s in there.
Nonsense, Faye’s in trouble.
Kate burst in and ran to the bed.
Faye’s eyes were wild and she was crying and moaning.
What is it?
What is it, dear?
Tell me, what is it?
Oh, darling—the dreams, the dreams!
I can’t stand them!
Kate turned to the door.
She’s had a nightmare—she’ll be all night.
You go back to bed.
I’ll stay with her a while.
Alex, bring a pot of tea.
Kate was tireless.
The other girls remarked on it.
Kate held a glass of it to Faye’s lips.
It will help, darling.
Drink it down.
I never want another drink.
Drink it down like medicine.
That’s a good girl.
Now just lie back and go to sleep.
I’m afraid to sleep.
Were the dreams so bad?
Tell me about them, Mother.
Maybe that will help.
Faye shrank back.
I wouldn’t tell anyone.
How I could have dreamed them!
They weren’t like my dreams.
Poor little Mother!
I love you, Kate said.
You go to sleep.
I’ll keep the dreams away.
Gradually Faye did slip off to sleep.
Kate sat beside the bed, studying her.
So often men trip by being in a rush.
Very few people learn this.
Kate never hurried.
Kate was in no hurry.
She set herself to work on method.
Her building was constructed of personalities, materials, knowledge, and time.
First the cook told about the will.
It must have been the cook.
He thought he did anyway.
she said mildly.
What do you think Miss Faye is going to think?
He looked confused.
You didn’t what—tell about it or think it would hurt?
You don’t think you told?
Only three people knew.
Do you think I told?
Or do you think Miss Faye did?
In a moment he would be sure that he had.
Alex should have kept his mouth shut.
Oh, we wouldn’t do that!
But you dare to talk behind her back!
No, Kate, no.
Well, I’ll have to tell her you asked.
Wouldn’t you rather be there?
I know I would.
I always like a person who comes right out.
Kate said, They asked me about a certain you-know-what.
Alex admits he let it out.
Faye was slightly puzzled.
Well, dear, I can’t see that it’s such a secret.
Kate said, Oh, I’m glad you feel that way.
You think it’s bad to tell, Kate?
Oh, not at all.
You’re sweet, Kate.
I don’t see any harm.
She takes such care of me.
Get the box, Kate.
He was a nice man and a pretty good doctor.
Does this hurt?
Well, I think you just need a kidney flushing.
The pills did good work.
She did have one little flare up.
She told Faye, I’ll go to the doctor’s office.
I’ll ask him to come here.
To bring me some more pills?
I’ll go in the morning.
Wilde was a good man and an honest man.
He was not casual about his practice.
He never learned to take death easily.
Wilde—Office Hours 11-2.
At nine-thirty Dr.
She had not been able to terminate her life neatly.
There were codicils.
Even now Dr.
Why, she had corrected the priest who prepared her.
The mystery of death was on him.
It often was.
Wilde knew it was a mystery.
His eyelids felt grainy.
The key would not turn.
He set his bag on the floor and exerted pressure.
The key refused to budge.
The door was opened from within.
Kate stood in front of him.
Oh, good morning.
Lock was stuck.
How did you get in?
It wasn’t locked.
I was early and came in to wait.
I’m getting old, I guess, he said.
I don’t know why I lock it anyway.
You could get in with a piece of baling wire.
And who’d want to get in anyway?
He seemed to see her for the first time.
I don’t have office hours until eleven.
You’re the girl from down at Faye’s.
Yes, the pills help.
Well, they can’t hurt, he said.
Did I leave the door to the dispensary open too?
What’s a dispensary?
Over there—that door.
I guess you must have.
How is Faye?
Well, I’m worried about her.
She was real sick a while ago.
Had cramps and went a little out of her head.
She’s had a stomach disorder before, Dr.
I can’t anyway.
We just call it stomach trouble.
Comes from eating too much and staying up all night.
Do you remember what color?
There were three kinds, yellow, red, and green.
Yes, I remember.
What a lot of medicines!
I got some of those when I started to practice.
Never used them.
That’s a beginner’s stock.
I was going to experiment—alchemy.
Here you are.
Tell Faye to get some sleep and eat some vegetables.
I’ve been up all night.
Let yourself out, will you?
He went wavering back into the surgery.
One book in the case was out of line.
The girls were sloppy and touchy.
But it didn’t work that way.
He discovered that cooking was something you couldn’t learn.
You had to feel it.
Cotton Eye learned that nobody hated him.
His tub-thumping piano playing changed imperceptibly.
Well, like this, and he played for her.
That’s lovely, she said.
What is it?
Well, I don’t know.
I think it’s Chopin.
If I could just see the music!
It was a bad story.
It don’t have words, said Cotton Eye.
Why, the girls—who else?
And did they ever taste seasoning like in that stew?
Can you imagine?
It’s sure nice, said Trixie.
Did you see the score on the blackboard this morning?
Sure I did—eighty-seven tricks in one week.
No holidays, hell.
Have you forgot it’s Lent?
They ain’t turning a trick at Jenny’s.
How do you feel, Mother?
Fine, just fine.
Her eyes were secretive.
Faye wasn’t very clever.
You know, Kate, I’d like to go to Europe.
Well, how wonderful!
And you deserve it and you can afford it.
I don’t want to go alone.
I want you to go with me.
Kate looked at her in astonishment.
You want to take me?
Sure, why not?
Oh, you sweet dear!
When can we go?
You want to?
I’ve always dreamed of it.
When can we go?
Let’s go soon.
Faye’s eyes lost their suspicion and her face relaxed.
Maybe next summer, she said.
We can plan it for next summer.
You—you don’t turn any tricks any more, do you?
Why should I?
You take such good care of me.
Kate pulled up a chair.
I want to ask your advice about something.
What is it?
Well, you know I’m trying to help you.
You’re doing everything, darling.
You aren’t planning to start preserving?
Well, why shouldn’t we?
What will Alex say to that?
Alex suggested it.
Well, he did.
Cross my heart.
Well, I’ll be damned—Oh, I’m sorry, sweet.
It slipped out.
Alex truly believed it was his idea.
It was pleasant and a ladylike time.
What a clever girl she is, Faye would say.
We’re going to Europe.
And did you know Kate speaks French?
Well, she can.
She’s teaching me.
Know how you say bread in French?
Faye was having a wonderful time.
Kate gave her excitement and perpetual planning.
I guess the winter’s nearly here, she said.
We’ll have to get Alex to set up the stoves.
Ready for your tonic, Mother dear?
Yes, I am.
You’re making me lazy, waiting on me.
I like to wait on you, said Kate.
Not much left, she said.
We’ll have to get some more.
Kate picked up the glass.
There’s a fly in the glass, she said.
I’ll just go and wash it out.
In the kitchen she rinsed the glass.
From her pocket she took the eye-dropper.
Faye drank her tonic and licked her lips.
It tastes bitter, she said.
Does it, dear?
Let nie taste.
So it does, she said.
I guess it’s been standing around too long.
I’m going to throw it out.
Say, that is bitter.
Let me get you a glass of water.
At supper Faye’s face was flushed.
She stopped eating and seemed to be listening.
What’s the matter?
Mother, what’s the matter?
Faye seemed to tear her attention away.
Why, I don’t know.
I guess a little heart flutter.
Don’t you want me to help you to your room?
No, dear, I feel all right now.
Grace put down her fork.
Well, you got a real high flush, Faye.
Kate said, I don’t like it.
I wish you’d see Dr.
No, it’s all right now.
You frightened me, said Kate.
Have you ever had it before?
Well, I’m a little short of breath sometimes.
I guess I’m getting too stout.
The next day Faye felt all right.
I guess I’m just short-winded, she said.
Honest to God, Kate.
I feel pretty good.
You frightened me last night.
I had an aunt who died of heart trouble.
And that leaves a memory, you know.
I never had any trouble with my heart.
Just a little short-winded when I climb the stairs.
In the kitchen Kate set the supper on two trays.
I didn’t think I was hungry, Faye said.
But that soup smells good.
I made a special salad dressing for you, said Kate.
It’s an old recipe, rosemary and thyme.
See if you like it.
Why, it’s delicious, said Faye.
Is there anything you can’t do darling?
Kate was stricken first.
Faye ran to the hallway, screaming for help.
Kate was writhing on the floor.
The sweat poured from her body and wet her clothes.
It was an hour before Dr.
Wilde could be found playing euchre with a friend.
Wilde said, What did you eat?
And then he noticed the trays.
Are these string beans home canned?
Sure, said Grace.
We did them right here.
Did any of you have them?
Go out and break every jar, Dr.
Goddam the string beans!
And he unpacked his stomach pump.
On Tuesday he sat with the two pale weak women.
Kate’s bed had been moved into Faye’s room.
I can tell you now, he said.
I didn’t think you had a chance.
You’re pretty lucky.
And let home-made string beans alone.
Buy canned ones.
What is it?
I guess it’s because you’re young and she’s tough.
He asked Faye, Are you still bleeding from the bowels?
Yes, a little.
Well, here are some morphine pills.
They’ll bind you up.
You’ve probably ruptured something.
But they say you can’t kill a whore.
Now take it easy, both of you.
That was October 17.
Faye was never really well again.
Wilde listened a long time through his stethoscope.
Grace said, God knows when’s the last sleep she had.
I might as well tell you, he said.
Her heart just can’t take the strain, I’m afraid.
She’s all torn up inside.
That goddam botulism.
Worse than a rattlesnake.
He looked away from Kate’s haggard face.
Not many people have such loyalty.
Then she brushed the lank blond hair and braided it.
She tried to speak, and Kate said, Shush!
Save your strength.
Save your strength.
Open up, Mother.
This is a new kind of medicine.
Now be brave, dear.
This will taste bad.
Kate slipped quietly out of the room.
The kitchen was dark.
The ground was damp from the spring rains.
From violence she went into a gloomy stupor.
It was a long time before she regained her health.
And she forgot completely about the will.
It was Trixie who finally remembered.
On the Trask place Adam drew into himself.
The laid-out vegetable gardens rioted with weeds.
He saw the world through gray water.
To Adam they were symbols of his loss.
Adam did not resist them.
Then Liza stepped in.
I want you to stay away from there, she said.
You come back a changed man.
Samuel, you don’t change him.
He changes you.
I can see the look of him in your face.
Have you thought of the two little boys, Liza?
I’ve thought of your own family, she said snappishly.
You lay a crepe on us for days after.
Samuel sold the equipment and sent Adam the money.
He had no answer.
He became aware of an anger at Adam Trask.
But there was little leisure to brood.
It worries her.
Liza was getting old.
But Liza was living backwards, and that’s the proof.
Una was married to a stranger and gone away.
Dessie had her dressmaking business in Salinas.
In King City, Dr.
Tilson felt him over.
The doctor grew more testy with his overworked years.
You sprained your back.
That I did, said Samuel.
Here’s your two dollars.
And you want to know what to do about it?
Sure I do.
Don’t sprain it any more.
Now take your money back.
You’re not a fool, Samuel, unless you’re getting childish.
But it hurts.
Of course it hurts.
How would you know it was strained if it didn’t?
You’re good for me, he said.
You’re more than two dollars good for me.
Keep the money.
The doctor looked closely at him.
I think you’re telling the truth, Samuel.
I’ll keep the money.
I’ve got a package made up for Mother, Will said.
Some little cans of things from France.
She’ll just send them to Joe, said Samuel.
Can’t you make her eat them?
No, said his father.
But she’ll enjoy sending them to Joe.
Lee came into the store and his eyes lighted up.
How do, Missy, he said.
How are the boys?
Be glad to have you join me.
Well, you can’t do any harm.
I thought he’d get over it.
But he still walks around like a ghost.
It’s over a year, isn’t it?
Three months over.
Well, what do you think I can do?
I don’t know, said Lee.
Maybe you could shock him out of it.
Nothing else has worked.
I’m not good at shocking.
I’d probably end up by shocking myself.
By the way, what did he name the twins?
They don’t have any names.
You’re making a joke, Lee.
I am not making jokes.
What does he call them?
He calls them they.
I mean when he speaks to them.
This is nonsense, Samuel said angrily.
What kind of fool is the man?
I’ve meant to come and tell you.
He’s a dead man unless you can wake him up.
Samuel said, I’ll come.
I’ll bring a horse whip.
You’re damn right I’ll come Lee.
I’ll kill a chicken, said Lee.
You’ll like the twins, Mr.
They’re fine-looking boys.
I won’t tell Mr.
Trask you’re coming.
He explained his purpose almost as though he were confessing.
Why, I don’t know, Mother.
He had not expected this.
I don’t know.
Well, it seemed so to me, he said lamely.
Samuel, do you think why you want to go?
Is it your natural incurable nosiness?
Is it your black inability to mind your own business?
Now, Liza, I know my failings pretty well.
I thought it might be more than that.
It had better be more than that, she said.
This man has not admitted that his sons live.
He has cut them off mid-air.
That’s the way it seems to me, Liza.
If he tells you to mind your own business—what then?
Well, I don’t know.
Her jaw snapped shut and her teeth clicked.
If you do I’ll have to go myself.
I’ll give him the back of my hand, Samuel said.
No, that you won’t do.
You fall short in savagery, Samuel.
I know you.
I’ll beat his brains out, Samuel shouted.
His white beard was brushed to shining.
Could I take the Bible along?
And the children’s names are in it.
She saw his face fall.
Take this one, she said.
But that’s your mother’s.
She wouldn’t mind.
I’ll wrap it so it won’t get hurt, said Samuel.
Liza spoke sharply.
You’re never satisfied to let the Testament alone.
You’re forever picking at it and questioning it.
I’m just trying to understand it, Mother.
What is there to understand?
Just read it.
There it is in black and white.
Who wants you to understand it?
Don’t agree with me all the time.
It hints of insincerity.
Speak up for yourself.
He’s a sweet husband, she said aloud, but contentious.
He said heroic words to himself.
Adam was more gaunt than Samuel remembered.
A grimace of displeasure drew down his mouth.
Samuel said, I feel small now—coming uninvited as I have.
Adam said, What do you want?
Didn’t I pay you?
Yes, you did.
Yes, by God, you did.
What are you trying to say?
Samuel’s anger grew and put out leaves.
A man, his whole life, matches himself against pay.
Adam exclaimed, I’ll pay.
I tell you I’ll pay.
You have, but not to me.
Why did you come then?
You once invited me.
I don’t invite you now.
Samuel put his hands on his hips and leaned forward.
I’ll tell you now, quiet.
So I invite myself.
You are not welcome.
What business is that of yours?
A kind of joy lighted Samuel’s eyes at the rudeness.
Don’t, for the love of God, put violence on me.
I don’t understand you.
How could you?
A dirty clod!
Samuel joyously felt hot rage in his stomach.
He cried, Oh, my friend, retreat from me!
Please, I beg of you!
The saliva dampened the corners of his mouth.
I feel murder nudging my gizzard.
Adam said, Get off my place.
Go on—get off.
You’re acting crazy.
This is my place.
I bought it.
You bought your eyes and nose, Samuel jeered.
You bought your uprightness.
You bought your thumb on sideways.
Listen to me, because I’m like to kill you after.
You bought out of some sweet inheritance.
Think now—do you deserve your children, man?
They’re here—I guess.
I don’t understand you.
Samuel wailed, God save me, Liza!
It’s not the way you think, Adam!
Get off, said Adam hoarsely.
Lee, bring a gun!
This man is crazy.
And Samuel was snarling at him.
Tear away with your jelly fingers.
You have them by some strange and lovely dispensation.
Adam stood panting.
He felt his throat where the blacksmith hands had been.
What is it you want of me?
You have no love.
I had—enough to kill me.
No one ever had enough.
The stone orchard celebrates too little, not too much.
Stay away from me.
I can fight back.
Don’t think I can’t defend myself.
You have two weapons, and they not named.
I’ll fight you, old man.
You are an old man.
Adam said, What I do is my own business.
He looked stonily at the menacing old man.
Adam replied, Their mother left them motherless.
And you have left them fatherless.
Don’t you remember, Adam, how it was, even a little?
I didn’t do it, Adam said.
Have you undone it?
Your boys have no names.
We’ll give them names, he said.
We’ll think long and find good names to clothe them.
He whipped the dust from Adam’s shirt with his hands.
But I’m grateful.
It’s a hurty thanks, but it’s thanks.
Samuel smiled, crinkle-eyed.
Did it seem natural?
Did I do it right?
What do you mean?
She didn’t believe I would.
I’m not a fighting man, you see.
There wasn’t any fear in it, Adam said.
It was more like a weariness.
I guess I was not angry enough.
Samuel, I’ll ask just once and then no more.
Have you heard anything?
Has there been any news of her—any news at all?
I’ve heard nothing.
It’s almost a relief, said Adam.
Do you have hatred?
No—only a kind of sinking in the heart.
Maybe later I’ll sort it out to hatred.
There was no interval from loveliness to horror, you see.
I’m confused, confused.
There’s something at the hens, said Adam.
A second shrieking started.
It’s Lee at the hens, said Samuel.
I didn’t get them, Lee said testily.
I had them.
A boy should be well dressed on his naming day.
You’ve dropped the pidgin, Lee.
I hope for good.
Of course I use it in King City.
Lee said, I’ll pour you a drink.
It’s some that was here.
It’s some you bought yesterday in King City, said Samuel.
His mind grinned inward at itself.
He lifted his eyes to Adam.
It’s hard to start, he said.
Could you give me a hand?
There’s a crashing in my head, he said.
Like sounds you hear under water.
I’m having to dig myself out of a year.
It’s hard to remember, he said.
It was not agony but a dullness.
But no—there were needles in it.
Maybe I’ll never have all the cards.
Is it herself trying to come out?
Maybe it’s that.
She did shoot you, didn’t she, Adam?
His lips grew thin and his eyes black.
Samuel said, There’s no need to answer.
There’s no reason not to, Adam replied.
Yes, she did.
Did she mean to kill you?
I’ve thought of that more than anything else.
No, I don’t think she meant to kill me.
She didn’t allow me that dignity.
There was no hatred in her, no passion at all.
I learned about that in the army.
No, she hit me where she intended.
I can see the gun barrel moving over.
That would have been a kind of love.
But I was an annoyance, not an enemy.
You’ve given it a lot of thought, said Samuel.
I’ve had lots of time for it.
I want to ask you something.
I can’t remember behind the last ugly thing.
Was she very beautiful, Samuel?
To you she was because you built her.
I don’t think you ever saw her—only your own creation.
Adam mused aloud, I wonder who she was—what she was.
I was content not to know.
And now you want to?
Adam dropped his eyes.
It’s not curiosity.
Yes, you will.
They will be what you expect of them.
I don’t very much believe in blood, said Samuel.
You can’t make a race horse of a pig.
No one hereabouts would agree with you.
I think even Mrs.
Hamilton would not.
That’s exactly right.
Let’s speak of the boys.
Will you have another drink?
That I will, thank you.
Names are a great mystery.
He leaned forward.
What is it?
Why, Adam cried, these boys are not alike!
They don’t look alike.
Of course they don’t.
They’re not identical twins.
That one—that one looks like my brother.
I just saw it.
I wonder if the other looks like me.
Both of them do.
It’s not so much now, said Adam.
Maybe that’s what ghosts are, Samuel observed.
Lee brought dishes out and put them on the table.
Do you have Chinese ghosts?
Millions, said Lee.
We have more ghosts than anything else.
I guess nothing in China ever dies.
It’s very crowded.
Anyway, that’s the feeling I got when I was there.
Samuel said, Sit down, Lee.
We’re trying to think of names.
I’ve got chicken frying.
It will be ready pretty soon.
Will you have a drink, Lee?
Take that one up, he said to Adam.
Adam held the other child awkwardly on his knee.
This one has rounder eyes than that one.
Yes, and a rounder head and bigger ears, Samuel added.
But this one is more like—like a bullet.
This one might go farther but not so high.
See how this one supports himself!
He’s farther along than that one—better developed.
Take it easy.
Do you want to fall?
We might be wrong—so wrong.
I thank you for coming, Samuel, he said.
I even thank you for hitting me.
That’s a strange thing to say.
It was a strange thing for me to do.
There’s a punishment for it, and it’s usually crucifixion.
I haven’t the courage for that.
It’s because I haven’t courage, said Samuel.
I could never quite take the responsibility.
There you have the difference between greatness and mediocrity.
It’s not an uncommon disease.
I’d think there are degrees of greatness, Adam said.
I don’t think so, said Samuel.
That would be like saying there is a little bigness.
There you make your choice.
He’s suffering over the choosing right now.
It’s a painful thing to watch.
And somewhere in me I want him to say yes.
Isn’t that strange?
A father to want his son condemned to greatness!
What selfishness that must be.
This naming is no simple business, I see.
Did you think it would be?
I didn’t know it could be so pleasant, said Adam.
I don’t know how good it will be, he said.
The hens are a little old.
We don’t have any pullets.
The weasels got the baby chicks this year.
Pull up, said Samuel.
Wait until I get my ng-ka-py, said Lee.
He trusts you now, Samuel said.
Just put the boys on the ground, he said.
The twins protested when they were set down.
The men ate quietly as nearly all country people do.
Suddenly Lee got up and hurried into the house.
He came back with a jug of red wine.
I forgot it, he said.
I found it in the house.
I remember drinking wine here before I bought the place.
Maybe I bought the place because of the wine.
The chicken’s good, Lee.
You’re getting well, Samuel said.
But the time poultice is no respecter of glories.
Everyone gets well if he waits around.
The wine and the glasses stayed on the table.
We’d best get on with the naming, Samuel said.
I can’t think what to name them, Adam said.
Samuel knocked his forehead with his knuckles.
What a shame, he said.
What do you mean?
Freshness, you said.
I thought last night— He paused.
Have you thought of your own name?
Your first-born—Cain and Abel.
Adam said, Oh, no.
No, we can’t do that.
I know we can’t.
That would be tempting whatever fate there is.
Adam looked into the ink-red wine in his glass.
I got a shiver when you mentioned it, he said.
And I don’t understand either of them.
I don’t understand them at all but I feel them.
Liza gets angry with me.
She says I should not try to understand them.
She says why should we try to explain a verity.
Maybe she’s right—maybe she’s right.
People like you to be something, preferably what they are.
Adam said, He asked you if you understood.
I think I understand the Fall.
I could perhaps feel that in myself.
But the brother murder—no.
Well, maybe I don’t remember the details very well.
Samuel said, Most people don’t read the details.
It’s the details that astonish me.
And Abel had no children.
He looked up at the sky.
Lord, how the day passes!
No, he said, I’m having enjoyment.
I take a pleasure in inquiring into things.
I don’t have a Bible, Adam said.
I left the family one in Connecticut.
I have, said Lee.
I’ll get it.
No need, said Samuel.
Liza let me take her mother’s.
It’s here in my pocket.
He took out the package and unwrapped the battered book.
This one has been scraped and gnawed at, he said.
I wonder what agonies have settled here.
Liza wears a Bible down evenly.
Here we are—this oldest story.
I’ll read it through and then we’ll go back.
He looked down at the ground.
Lee got up.
I’ll cover them, he said.
The dust is warm, said Samuel.
Now it goes this way.
Samuel read,  And she again bare his brother Abel.
Lee said, Now there—no, go on, go on.
We’ll come back.
And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth?
And why is thy countenance fallen?
If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?
And he said, I know not.
Am I my brother’s keeper?
And he said, What hast thou done?
There it is, he said.
Sixteen verses, no more.
And oh, Lord!
Maybe Liza’s right.
There’s nothing to understand.
Adam sighed deeply.
It’s not a comforting story, is it?
What a great burden of guilt men have!
Lee said, So do I, so does everyone.
It must be that we want it that way.
Aron broke in, It makes me feel better, not worse.
How do you mean?
Well, every little boy thinks he invented sin.
But sin is our own designing.
Yes, I see.
But how does this story make it better?
Because, Adam said excitedly, we are descended from this.
This is our father.
Some of our guilt is absorbed in our ancestry.
What chance did we have?
We are the children of our father.
It means we aren’t the first.
Not convincing ones anyway, said Lee.
Excuse or not, we are snapped back to our ancestry.
We have guilt.
Adam said, I remember being a little outraged at God.
I never thought that was a just thing.
I never understood it.
Maybe we think out of a different background, said Lee.
They were not farmers.
A sacrifice must be the best and most valuable.
Yes, I can see that, said Samuel.
Adam was excited.
Yes, but why did God condemn Cain?
That’s an injustice.
Samuel said, There’s an advantage to listening to the words.
God did not condemn Cain at all.
Even God can have a preference, can’t he?
Let’s suppose God liked lamb better than vegetables.
I think I do myself.
Cain brought him a bunch of carrots maybe.
And God said, I don’t like this.
But Cain got mad.
His feelings were hurt.
Lee said, St.
Paul says to the Hebrews that Abel had faith.
There’s no reference to it in Genesis, Samuel said.
No faith or lack of faith.
Only a hint of Cain’s temper.
Lee asked, How does Mrs.
Hamilton feel about the paradoxes of the Bible?
Adam said, You two have studied this.
Then Cain was driven out for murder?
That’s right—for murder.
And God branded him?
Did you listen?
It was a preserving mark.
Maybe he did, said Samuel.
We are Cain’s children.
Lee said, Remember, Mr.
No, don’t worry.
I won’t read it.
And I wondered why.
And, of course, people are interested only in themselves.
Samuel said, Apply that to the Cain-Abel story.
I think I can, Lee answered Samuel.
Maybe there would be fewer crazy people.
It is all there—the start, the beginning.
The human is the only guilty animal.
And what do you think of my Oriental patter, Mr.
You know I am no more Oriental than you are.
I want to think, he said.
Damn you, I want to think.
Maybe you’ve tumbled a world for me.
I don’t know, damn you.
You’ve disturbed my pretty universe.
Let me alone—let me think!
Your damned bitch is having pups in my brain already.
Oh, I wonder what my Tom will think of this!
He’ll cradle it in the palm of his mind.
Adam, come out now.
You’ve been long enough in whatever memory it was.
He sighed deeply.
Isn’t it too simple?
I’m always afraid of simple things.
It isn’t simple at all, said Lee.
It’s desperately complicated.
But at the end there’s light.
There’s not going to be light long, Samuel said.
We’ve sat and let the evening come.
We’ve swung ourselves on a pole.
They like complications but they like their own.
I’ll have to be driving home.
Adam said desperately, Name me some names.
From the Bible?
Well, let’s see.
Would you like them for a symbol?
Caleb and Joshua.
Joshua was a soldier—a general.
I don’t like soldiering.
Well, Caleb was a captain.
But not a general.
I kind of like Caleb—Caleb Trask.
You called his name, said Samuel.
You don’t like Joshua, and Caleb’s named.
He’s the smart one—the dark one.
See, the other one is awake too.
The second boy almost joyfully began to cry.
That’s good enough, said Adam.
Suddenly Samuel laughed.
Lee took the boys up under his arms.
Have you got them straight?
Of course, said Adam.
That one is Caleb and you are Aaron.
Yesterday I couldn’t tell them apart, said Adam.
Aaron and Caleb.
Liza would have preferred Joshua.
She loves the crashing walls of Jericho.
I’ll go and hitch up my rig.
Adam walked to the shed with him.
I’m glad you came, he said.
There’s a weight off me.
I can see it there the way you planned it.
Adam was long in answering.
I can’t feel the pull of it.
I have money enough to live.
I never wanted it for myself.
I have no one to show a garden to.
Don’t think it will ever die, he cried.
Don’t expect it.
Are you better than other men?
I tell you it won’t ever die until you do.
This happens often in the world.
Of all his daughters Una was Samuel’s greatest joy.
Of all the children Una had the least humor.
His question was about photography.
The inductive leap was not for him.
Anderson never fell, never slipped back, never flew.
Una wrote bleak letters without joy but also without self-pity.
She was well and she hoped her family was well.
Her husband was near to his discovery.
And then she died and her body was shipped home.
I never knew Una.
Una was not a beautiful girl like Mollie, he said.
But she had the loveliest hands and feet.
And Una had lovely skin too, translucent, even glowing.
She didn’t laugh and play like the rest of us.
There was something set apart about her.
She seemed always to be listening.
We were always full of bull.
There was some pure simple thing in Una, George said.
And then they brought her home.
And her skin was rough as rawhide.
We think it was an accident, he said.
So many chemicals around.
We think it was.
Una’s death struck Samuel like a silent earthquake.
He felt that it was his neglect had done it.
He became an old man.
His other children were doing well.
George was in the insurance business.
Will was getting rich.
Joe’s very faults were virtues in this field.
Joe was a big man in a new field.
Only Tom had never got started.
Samuel told Adam Trask that Tom was arguing with greatness.
And under all of this was a shrinking—a shy shrinking.
Tom said, I’ve tried and it just seems tiresome.
I’ve thought why this must be.
Without these it is meaningless.
I would do it if I felt anything—good or bad.
Will did not understand this.
Maybe Tom opened up a little more for children.
Who knows whether it will be correct?
My sister Mary did not want to be a girl.
It was a misfortune she could not get used to.
I used to help her cross her fingers like shiplap.
Of course what?
Uncle Tom what?
He’ll know how to get to be a boy.
There it was—just as simple as that.
I wondered why I hadn’t thought of it myself.
We had a series of girls.
We charged in.
Is he up?
He got in late.
You let him sleep.
There was always a little diffidence between us at first.
I think Uncle Tom was as shy as we were.
Thank you for the gum, Uncle Tom.
I’m glad you liked it.
We’ll certainly try, if your mother will let you.
We drifted into the sitting room and sat down.
They’re all right, Ollie, he called back.
We sat in a triangle in the living room.
Tom’s face was so dark and his eyes so blue.
He wore good clothes but he never seemed well dressed.
In this he was very different from his father.
Why, Mary, you’re just born a boy.
No, that’s not what I mean.
How do I get to be a boy?
Tom studied her gravely.
Her words poured out.
I don’t want to be a girl, Uncle Tom.
I want to be a boy.
A girl’s all kissing and dolls.
I don’t want to be a girl.
I don’t want to.
Tears of anger welled up in Mary’s eyes.
He wanted to say something beautiful, I think.
I wouldn’t like you to be a boy, he said.
I like you as a girl.
An idol was crashing in Mary’s temple.
You mean you like girls?
Yes, Mary, I like girls very much.
A look of distaste crossed Mary’s face.
If it were true, Tom was a fool.
She put on her don’t-give-me-any-of-that-crap tone.
Tom had a good ear.
Tom studied her cold and hostile eyes.
I don’t think you really want to change.
Tom was wrong—she really did.
Well, he said, you can’t.
And someday you’ll be glad.
Mary was braver and more ruthless than most.
That’s why she won every marble in Salinas.
Tom looked ruefully after her.
She’s a girl all right, he said.
I love oyster loaves, I said.
Sure you do.
So does Mary.
No, I don’t, he said sadly.
I would have told her if I had known.
She’s the best pitcher in the West End.
Would you like to have my fly cage, Uncle Tom?
Oh, he was a great gentleman.
Do you want me to have it?
I’d like to have it very much.
Thank you, John.
And this was very wonderful.
And suddenly the head became alive.
He gave the head not to me but to us.
Sometimes Tom took me fishing.
I don’t remember that Tom talked.
Maybe he didn’t talk at all.
Tom had beautiful tackle and made his own flies.
He needed not to triumph over animals.
Tom felt his darkness.
Poetry was a symptom of weakness, of degeneracy and decay.
To read it was to court catcalls.
To write it was to be suspected and ostracized.
Poetry was a secret vice, and properly so.
Of all his family Tom loved Dessie best.
She was gay.
Laughter lived on her doorstep.
Her shop was a unique institution in Salinas.
It was a woman’s world.
The door was closed to men.
And from this freedom came laughter, roars of laughter.
Nothing so healthy as Dessie had ever happened to Salinas.
And then Dessie fell in love.
Samuel did not lecture Tom.
He took him home and never mentioned the incident.
And a stillness fell on the Hamilton place.
They were all married save Dessie and Tom.
Their children filled the Hamilton place with riot.
The home place flared up—noisier than it had ever been.
The children cried and screamed and fought.
Liza’s little round face grew redder and redder.
She organized and ordered.
The kitchen stove never went out.
Samuel dug up his old gaiety.
Martin, Olive and Ernest Steinbeck, Will and his Deila.
Samuel was ah old man.
Somehow they had not believed it could happen.
His shoulders—did you see how they slump?
And there’s no spring in his step.
His eyes are old.
He never would go to bed until last.
It’s his skin told me.
He favors his right leg.
Yes, but that’s the one the horse broke.
I know, but he never favored it before.
They said these things in outrage.
This can’t happen, they were saying.
Father can’t be an old man.
Samuel is young as the dawn—the perpetual dawn.
He might get old as midday maybe, but sweet God!
the evening cannot come, and the night—?
Sweet God, no!
What would the spring be like, or Christmas, or rain?
There couldn’t be a Christmas.
They turned on Tom.
You were here.
You’ve been here all along!
How did this happen?
When did it happen?
Who did this to him?
Have you by any chance done this with your craziness?
It was Una, he said hoarsely.
He couldn’t get over Una.
Why didn’t you tell us?
Maybe we could have done something.
Tom leaped up, violent and cringing.
What was there to tell?
That he was dying of sorrow?
That the marrow had melted out of his bones?
What was there to tell?
You weren’t here.
They were ashamed.
Will Martin said, I’ll go out and bring him back.
Don’t do it.
Let him alone.
We know him from the insides of ourselves.
In a little while Tom came back.
I want to apologize, he said.
I’m very sorry.
Maybe I’m a little drunk.
Father calls it jolly’ when I do it.
Why, Tom, you were just jolly.
Jolly,’ if I did it.
A drunken man didn’t crawl home.
George stopped the crazy flow of talk.
We want to apologize to you, Tom, he said.
Or maybe we did mean to.
And we’re sorry.
Will Martin said realistically, It’s too hard a life here.
He could have a long and happy life.
I don’t think he’d do it, said Will.
He’s stubborn as a mule and proud as a horse.
He’s got a pride like brass.
We would like to have him—or both of them—with us.
You’re right, Will, George agreed.
He would think it was like quitting.
He’d feel it was a cowardice.
Will said, There’s another way.
Maybe he could come for a visit.
Tom can run the ranch.
It’s time Father and Mother saw something of the world.
All kinds of things are happening.
And after a while maybe he wouldn’t have to.
Dessie brushed the hair out of her eyes.
We can try it anyway.
What do you all think?
Tom, wouldn’t you be willing to take over the ranch?
Oh, that’s nothing, said Tom.
Then why don’t you agree?
I’d find a reluctance to insult my father, Tom said.
But where’s the harm in suggesting it?
I don’t forbid you, he said.
But I can’t do it.
There’s years of visiting among the lot of us.
And that was how they left it.
He watched his father from the corners of his eyes.
Samuel stood up and sauntered down the hill.
Why, you’re a grown-up man, he said.
Didn’t you know?
Liza was rolling out pie crust on the floury board.
His eyes were smiling.
Can’t you find something to do this time of day?
Oh, I guess I could, Mother, if I wanted to.
Well, don’t sit there and make me nervous.
The paper’s in the other room if you’re feeling day-lazy.
I’ve read it, said Samuel.
All of it?
All I want to.
Samuel, what’s the matter with you?
You’re up to something.
I can see it in your face.
He swung his leg and smiled at her.
Such a little bit of a wife, he said.
Three of her is hardly a bite.
Samuel, now you stop this.
Now you go along.
Now don’t you make jokes in the morning.
Do you, Liza?
Of course I do.
Don’t play me for a fool.
What does it mean?
Now, Samuel, get out with your fooling.
I wonder how you know the word.
Will you tell me what you’re after?
Why shouldn’t I know?
Did you ever have one, Liza?
Why, I— She stopped.
Samuel, please go out of my kitchen, she said apprehensively.
He took the letter from his pocket and unfolded it.
It’s from Ollie, he said.
She wants us to come and visit in Salinas.
They’ve fixed over the upstairs rooms.
She wants us to get to know the children.
She’s got us tickets for the Chautauqua season.
I’d like to hear that.
Liza rubbed her nose and floured it with her finger.
Is it very costly?
she asked anxiously.
Ollie has bought the tickets.
They’re a present.
We can’t go, said Liza.
Who’d run the ranch?
Tom would—what running there is to do in the winter.
He’d be lonely.
See what’s in the letter, Liza.
What are those?
Two tickets to Salinas on the train.
No, I can’t.
Why, Liza—Mother—now don’t.
Here—here’s a handkerchief.
That’s a dish towel, said Liza.
Sit here, Mother.
I know it’s a dish towel.
That’s a blasphemy, said Liza.
But I’d like to see it, wouldn’t you?
What did you say?
Hold up your head.
I didn’t hear you.
What did you say?
I said yes, said Liza.
Samuel looked at the drawing.
What is it?
Here’s the pull-rod to open the latch.
What’s going to open it?
I figured a strong spring.
Samuel studied the drawing.
Then what’s going to close it?
This bar here.
I see, said Samuel.
It might work too, if the gate was truly hung.
I know, said his father.
But the main reason is that it’s fun.
Caught me, he said.
Why, sure, said Tom.
Where do you plan to go?
Why, that would be fine, said Tom.
Is Mother agreeable?
She is, always forgetting the expense.
That’s fine, said Tom.
How long do you plan to be gone?
But it was there.
I think that’s good.
I don’t know what you mean, said Tom.
And it’s working smooth as butter.
I see Will’s hand in this.
Don’t tell me if you don’t want to.
I wasn’t in favor of it, said Tom.
It doesn’t sound like you, his father said.
Don’t tell the others I know.
It’s not clever but it’s more permanent.
I’m glad you’re going.
Tom, I’ll trade you honor for honor.
Her life continued evenly.
She felt sorrow but she survived it.
His world did not have death as a member.
He, and all around him, was immortal.
It was a personal opponent and one he could lick.
To Liza it was simply death—the thing promised and expected.
She was a complete realist.
She was curious about them and their children.
She had no love of places.
And she was tired.
She would find something to do in Heaven.
She was gay and frightened about the visit to Salinas.
And the Chautauqua?
Well, she didn’t have to go and probably wouldn’t.
Samuel would run wild—she would have to watch him.
Places were very important to Samuel.
He saved his visit to the Trask place for last.
He had not been there for months.
Adam was not a young man any more.
Lee walked to the shed with Samuel.
But there’s so much to do.
You know how it is, Samuel said.
I heard about your daughter.
I got your letter, Lee.
I have it.
You said good things.
Chinese things, said Lee.
I seem to get more Chinese as I get older.
There’s something changed about you, Lee.
What is it?
It’s my queue, Mr.
I’ve cut off my queue.
We all did.
Haven’t you heard?
The Dowager Empress is gone.
China is free.
It was a proclamation of the new government.
There’s not a queue left anywhere.
Does it make a difference, Lee?
It’s hard to get used to the convenience of it.
How is Adam?
He’s all right.
But he hasn’t changed much.
I wonder what he was like before.
Yes, I’ve wondered about that.
It was a short flowering.
The boys must be big.
They are big.
I’m glad I stayed here.
Did you teach them Chinese?
Trask didn’t want me to.
And I guess he was right.
It would have been a needless complication.
But I’m their friend—yes, I’m their friend.
They admire their father, but I think they love me.
And they’re very different.
You can’t imagine how different.
In what way, Lee?
You’ll see when they come home from school.
They’re like two sides of a medal.
And you don’t like Cal?
I find myself defending him—to myself.
I have the same thing in my brood, said Samuel.
I don’t understand it.
Will you stay to dinner?
Lee’s got a pot roast.
I had no reason to plant it, Adam said.
We had that out before.
You thought I would change.
I have not changed.
Do you take pride in your hurt?
Does it make you seem large and tragic?
I don’t know.
Well, think about it.
A slight anger came into Adam’s voice.
Why do you come to lecture me?
I’m a nosy man.
It seems a waste.
Is it a good feeling to let life lie fallow?
What else could I do?
You could try again.
Adam faced him.
I’m afraid to, Samuel, he said.
I’d rather just go about it this way.
Maybe I haven’t the energy or the courage.
How about your boys—do you love them?
Do you love one more than the other?
Why do you say that?
I don’t know.
Something about your tone.
Let’s go back to the house, said Adam.
They strolled back under the trees.
Did you ever hear such a rumor?
Yes—but I don’t believe it.
I can’t believe it.
He said at last, You have never let her go.
I guess not.
But I’ve let the shooting go.
I don’t think about it any more.
It’s small mining—small mining.
You’re too young a man to be panning memories, Adam.
Samuel glanced at him.
That’s right, he said.
Set your teeth in it.
How we do defend a wrongness!
Stop it, Adam shouted at him.
Goddam you, stop it!
Stop nosing over my life!
You’re like a coyote sniffing around a dead cow.
All of these years I’ve cheated Liza.
But I’ll never know that.
You make me doubt myself, he said fiercely.
You always have.
I’m afraid of you.
What should I do, Samuel?
I don’t know how you saw the thing so clear.
What should I do?
I know the shoulds,’ although I never do them, Adam.
I always know the shoulds.
You should try to find a new Cathy.
That’s the second-best should.
I’m afraid to try, said Adam.
That’s what you’ve said.
And now I’m going to put a selfishness on you.
I’m going away, Adam.
I came to say good-by.
What do you mean?
Well, you’ll be back.
Well, won’t you like that?
You’ve earned it.
You’ve worked hard enough on that dust heap of yours.
I love that dust heap, Samuel said.
Somewhere in my dust heap there’s a richness.
You deserve a rest.
There, you’ve said it again, said Samuel.
That’s what I had to accept, and I have accepted.
Do you believe that?
That’s what I have accepted.
Adam said excitedly, You can’t do that.
Why, if you accept that you won’t live!
I know, said Samuel.
But you can’t do that.
I don’t want you to.
I’m a nosy old man, Adam.
Samuel smiled at him.
What a nice thing to hear!
And I thank you.
It’s a good thing to be loved, even late.
I know what you’ve done for me, Adam said.
I can’t return anything.
But I can ask you for one more thing.
I would if I could.
We could raise flower-seeds.
There’s money in that.
Think how they would smell on the west wind!
And indeed his eyes were wet.
I thank you, Adam, he said.
Then you’ll do it?
No, I will not do it.
And maybe I’ll get to believe it happened.
But I want to do it.
Go and see my Tom.
He’ll help you.
You know what you’re doing, Samuel?
What a stubborn man you are!
Contentious, said Samuel.
The dinner table was set in the house.
So it is, Lee, said Samuel.
It’s a long time since I’ve seen you, boys.
But we named you well.
You’re Caleb, aren’t you?
Well, Cal then.
And he turned to the other.
Are you called Aaron?
He spells it with one a.
The two a’s seem a little fancy to his friends.
I’ve got thirty-five Belgian hares, sir, Aron said.
Would you like to see them, sir?
The hutch is up by the spring.
I’ve got eight newborns—just born yesterday.
I’d like to see them, Aron.
His mouth twitched.
Cal, don’t tell me you’re a gardener?
Lee’s head snapped around and he inspected Samuel.
Don’t do that, Lee said nervously.
Aron said, I’ve got a buck rabbit weighs fifteen pounds.
They heard Adam’s bedroom door opening.
Don’t tell him, Aron said quickly.
It’s a secret.
Lee sawed at the pot roast.
Always you bring trouble for my mind, Mr.
Hamilton, he said.
Sit down, boys.
And, Don’t you tell, said Aron.
I won’t, Samuel assured him.
Don’t tell what?
Samuel said, Can’t there be a privacy?
I have a secret with your son.
I’ll like to hear it, said Samuel.
Lee looked up from his carving and glared at Samuel.
He began piling meat on the plates.
The boys ate quickly and quietly, wolfed their food.
Aron said, Will you excuse us, Father?
Adam nodded, and the two boys went quickly out.
Samuel looked after them.
They seem older than eleven, he said.
These seem like grown men.
Lee said, I think I see why that is.
There was nothing to gain by it.
I don’t know whether that is good or bad.
He has taught me a great deal.
You must have learned from him, Adam.
Why didn’t you want the boys to learn Chinese, Adam?
Adam thought for a moment.
It seems a time for honesty, he said at last.
I guess it was plain jealousy.
That’s reasonable, enough and almost too human, said Samuel.
But knowing it—that’s a great jump.
I wonder whether I have ever gone so far.
And then Lee laughed.
You’ve given me great trouble, Mr.
Hamilton, and you’ve disturbed the tranquillity of China.
How do you mean, Lee?
It’s an amusing story anyway.
Don’t you want to hear, Adam?
Or are you slipping into your cloud bath?
I was thinking of that, said Adam.
It’s funny—a kind of excitement is coming over me.
That’s good, said Samuel.
Let’s hear your story, Lee.
I guess I used it more than I knew.
Yes, the story.
I told you, Mr.
Hamilton, that I was growing more Chinese.
Do you ever grow more Irish?
It comes and goes, said Samuel.
I do indeed.
And that’s a long time ago.
Ten years nearly, said Lee.
There was only one place that bothered me.
And his children didn’t do it entirely, he said.
Lee sipped his coffee.
Then I got a copy of the American Standard Bible.
It was very new then.
And it was different in this passage.
It says, Do thou rule over him.
Now this is very different.
This is not a promise, it is an order.
And I began to stew about it.
Lee, he said, don’t tell me you studied Hebrew!
Lee said, I’m going to tell you.
And it’s a fairly long story.
Will you have a touch of ng-ka-py?
You mean the drink that tastes of good rotten apples?
I can talk better with it.
Maybe I can listen better, said Samuel.
No, said Adam.
He didn’t tell me.
Maybe I wasn’t listening.
There’s a lot of wormwood in this.
It’s quite a drink, he said.
Samuel sipped the drink.
You say the man.
We have had a few such minds in China too.
I just wanted to know, said Samuel.
You’re not a Presbyterian after all.
I told you I was getting more Chinese.
Do you know about them?
The Lee family is very large.
It takes care of its own.
I have heard of them, said Samuel.
I guess so.
It’s a little different from that, really, said Lee.
They are thinkers in exactness.
They are fine old men.
Lee dampened his tongue in the black brew.
We discussed the story all night long.
I guess it’s funny, he said.
I know I wouldn’t dare tell it to many people.
They engaged a learned rabbi.
They took to the study as though they were children.
Exercise books, grammar, vocabulary, simple sentences.
Oh, they were perfectionists!
They went to the root of the matter.
I bought every known Hebrew dictionary.
But the old gentlemen were always ahead of me.
The questions, the inspection, oh, the lovely thinking—the beautiful thinking.
And this was the gold from our mining: Thou mayest.
Thou mayest rule over sin.
Samuel said, It’s a fantastic story.
And I’ve tried to follow and maybe I’ve missed somewhere.
Why is this word so important?
Lee’s hand shook as he filled the delicate cups.
He drank his down in one gulp.
Don’t you see?
It might be the most important word in the world.
That says the way is open.
That throws it right back on a man.
Don’t you see?
Yes, I see.
I do see.
But you do not believe this is divine law.
Why do you feel its importance?
I’ve wanted to tell you this for a long time.
I even anticipated your questions and I am well prepared.
Nothing they may do can interfere with what will be.
But Thou mayest’!
Lee’s voice was a chant of triumph.
Adam said, Do you believe that, Lee?
Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.
But think of the glory of the choice!
That makes a man a man.
A cat has no choice, a bee must make honey.
There’s no godliness there.
They are critics of truth.
But this—this is a ladder to climb to the stars.
Lee’s eyes shone.
You can never lose that.
Neither do I, said Lee.
And I feel that I am a man.
This is not theology.
I have no bent toward gods.
It is a lovely and unique thing in the universe.
It is always attacked and never destroyed—because Thou mayest.
A silence lay on the hills.
The three men were silent.
Samuel did not answer.
You’ve had that horse forever, Adam said.
He’s thirty-three, said Samuel.
His teeth are worn off.
I have to feed him warm mash with my fingers.
And he has bad dreams.
He shivers and cries sometimes in his sleep.
I know it.
He’s hammerheaded and swaybacked.
He has a pinched chest and a big behind.
He even has an ugly disposition.
He is selfish and quarrelsome and mean and disobedient.
And I love him.
Lee said, And you named him Doxology.
He hasn’t very long now.
He must have aches and pains.
Well, he doesn’t think so.
Doxology still thinks he’s one hell of a horse.
Would you shoot him, Adam?
Yes, I think I would.
Yes, I would.
You’d take the responsibility?
Yes, I think I would.
His lifespan is long over.
Lee had set his lantern on the ground.
I’ve been bothered by something, Adam, he said.
What is that?
Samuel said quickly, Do you like your life, Adam?
Of course not.
Inspect yourself, man.
No, said Samuel.
Lee said, Be careful, Mr.
What is this?
Tell me what you’re thinking of.
Are you sure you’re right?
Lee asked anxiously.
Of course I’m not sure.
Adam, do you want the medicine?
Adam, Cathy is in Salinas.
The crippled and crooked come there for satisfaction.
But it is worse than that.
Now, there’s your medicine.
Let’s see what it does to you.
You’re a liar!
Many things I am, but a liar I am not.
Adam whirled on Lee.
Is this true?
I’m no antidote, said Lee.
They could hear his heavy steps running and tripping.
Lee said, Your medicine acts like poison.
I take responsibility, said Samuel.
The shock of pain can counteract the poison.
Without the shock he will surely die.
But how do you know this is the same?
But without it he would surely die.
You’re a brave man, Lee said.
No, I’m an old man.
Lee asked, What do you suppose he’ll do?
Here, hold the lantern for me, will you?
The check rein had been abandoned long ago.
Samuel didn’t care.
I’ll walk back.
Samuel said, Get on with it, Lee.
What is it you want to say?
Lee did not appear surprised.
Maybe I’m nosy the way you say you are.
I get to thinking.
I know probabilities, but tonight you fooled me completely.
Did you know about her?
Do the boys know?
You know how cruel children are.
Someday in the schoolyard it will be shouted at them.
Think about that, Lee.
My question isn’t answered, Mr.
How were you able to do what you did?
Do you think I was that wrong?
No, I don’t mean that at all.
This has been my judgment.
Are you interested?
You’re a kind man, Mr.
But if you want to know why—look into yourself.
I don’t understand you.
I still don’t understand you.
Careful, Lee, you’ll get me talking.
I told you my Irish came and went.
It’s coming now.
Lee said, Mr.
Hamilton, you’re going away and you’re not coming back.
You do not intend to live very much longer.
That’s true, Lee.
How did you know?
There’s death all around you.
It shines from you.
I didn’t know anyone could see it, Samuel said.
A single note only—and that note unchanging sorrow.
I’m not alone in my attitude, Lee.
Lee said, Maybe everyone is too rich.
It was your two-word retranslation, Lee—Thou mayest.
It took me by the throat and shook me.
Lee was peering at him’ through the darkness.
 Thou mayest rule over sin,’ Lee.
I do not believe all men are destroyed.
Thou mayest, Thou mayest!
But the choice, Lee, the choice of winning!
I had never understood it or accepted it before.
Do you see now why I told Adam tonight?
I exercised the choice.
What is that word, Lee?
Timshel, said Lee.
Will you stop the cart?
You’ll have a long walk back.
Lee climbed down.
Here am I.
The old man chuckled.
Liza hates for me to say that.
Samuel, you’ve gone beyond me.
It’s time, Lee.
He stood up and walked toward the road.
Someone had brought them in and they had become weeds.
Adam had come up on the morning train.
He had to go to the cemetery.
Custom would have been outraged else.
The rain droplets grew larger and drove stinging along.
He walked out of the cemetery.
It was nearly a mile to the Monterey road.
At John Street the road angled and became Main Street.
He increased his speed.
Lapierre behind the bar saw the chill.
You’d better have another one, he said.
You’ll get a bad cold.
Would you like a hot rum?
That will knock it out of you.
Yes, I would, said Adam.
You sip another cognac while I get some hot water.
Lapierre brought a steaming kettle from the kitchen.
That will shake the chill out of an aspen.
He drew a chair up, sat down, then stood up.
You’ve made me cold, he said.
I’m going to have one myself.
It’s working, he said.
You’re a stranger?
I’m from near King City, Adam said.
Come up for the funeral?
Yes—he was an old friend.
I’m not surprised.
He had lots of friends.
Too bad it couldn’t have been a nice day.
I will, said Adam.
It makes me comfortable and peaceful.
That’s worth something.
Might have saved you from pneumonia too.
You can wipe off some of that mud, he said.
It didn’t rain till after, said Adam.
It was walking back I got wet.
Why don’t you get a nice room right here?
I think I’ll do that, said Adam.
The blood pounded behind his eyes.
I might have one more toddy, he said.
Lapierre said, If it’s for cold, you’ve had enough.
I’d rather you’d have that straight.
It’s fifty years old.
The water would kill the flavor.
I just want a drink, said Adam.
I’ll have one with you.
I haven’t opened that jug in months.
Not much call for it.
This is a whisky-drinking town.
He took a drink of the dark rum and coughed.
The room seemed to tip sideways and then right itself.
Good, isn’t it?
But it can knock you over.
Adam leaned his elbows on the table.
I don’t get up here much, he said.
Do you know a place called Kate’s?
That rum is better than I thought, Mr.
Got a place near King City.
My name’s Trask.
Glad to meet you.
You go to Jenny’s.
Let Kate alone.
That’s not good for you.
Jenny’s is right next door.
You go there and you’ll get everything you need.
Right next door?
Anybody’ll tell you where the Line is.
Adam’s tongue was getting thick.
What’s the matter with Kate’s?
You go to Jenny’s, said Mr.
It was a dirty gusty evening.
Adam had his instructions.
A soft voice said, Won’t you come in?
Adam could feel a thick carpet under his feet.
He got a quick impression of richness and order.
The soft voice said, You should have worn a raincoat.
Do we know you?
No, you don’t, said Adam.
Who sent you?
A man at the hotel.
Adam peered at the girl before him.
She was dressed in black and wore no ornaments.
Her face was sharp—pretty and sharp.
It was some secret and predatory animal.
Sit down—over here.
You did come here for something, didn’t you?
The low voice had a precise and husky power.
She made Adam seem clumsy to himself.
He blurted out, I want to see Kate.
Miss Kate is busy now.
Does she expect you?
I can take care of you, you know.
I want to see Kate.
You can’t see her.
Well, will you tell her I’m here?
Does she know you?
I don’t know.
He felt his courage going.
This was a remembered cold.
I don’t know.
She’ll know then whether I know her or not.
Well, I’ll tell her.
The girl parted the deep folds and disappeared.
Adam sat back in his chair.
Kate’s private room was comfort and efficiency.
Kate sat in the swivel chair behind the desk.
She was still pretty.
Her hair was blond again.
But her outlines were not sharp anywhere.
Still, she was pretty and neat.
The work of the years had been subtle.
The scar on her forehead was barely visible.
The faces of the women were never toward the camera.
Oh, come in, Eva.
Is he here?
The girl came to the desk before she replied.
It’s a new one, a stranger.
He says he wants to see you.
Well, he can’t, Eva.
You know who’s coming.
I told him you couldn’t see him.
He said he thought he knew you.
Well, who is he, Eva?
He’s a big gangly man, a little bit drunk.
He says his name is Adam Trask.
Kate sat still as though she held her breath.
Eva was jittery.
Just sit still a minute.
Eva cringed and went to the big chair.
Don’t pick your nails, said Kate.
Go to your room and fix yourself up.
Don’t take it all—no, I won’t trust you.
Now hurry up!
Watch him to see he doesn’t creep up.
After that bring Mr.
Adam Trask to me.
Will you be all right, Miss Kate?
Kate looked at her until she turned away.
Now hurry up.
Eva’s eyes were wet, and she was relaxed.
Her eyes, cold and expressionless, remained on his eyes.
He sighed deeply.
Kate’s hand shook a little.
She said, What do you want?
Adam sat down in the straight chair beside the desk.
I just wanted to see you.
Sam Hamilton told me you were here.
Hadn’t you heard before?
No, he said.
I hadn’t heard.
She said, You frightened me.
Well, I didn’t know what you’d do.
I didn’t forget you, he said.
But now I can.
What do you mean?
He laughed pleasantly.
Now I see you, I mean.
I remember your face but I had never seen it.
Now I can forget it.
You think you can?
I know I can.
She changed her manner.
Maybe you won’t have to, she said.
I don’t think so, said Adam.
You were such a fool, she said.
Like a child.
You didn’t know what things to do with yourself.
I can teach you now.
You seem to be a man.
You have taught me, he said.
It was a pretty sharp lesson.
Would you like a drink?
Yes, he said.
I can smell your breath—you’ve been drinking rum.
Come, sit over here, she said.
It’s more comfortable.
He sat holding his glass, and she said, Drink it.
It’s very good rum.
He smiled at her, a smile she had never seen.
I would have come back, he said.
Drink your rum, she said.
He glanced at her glass.
Smiling, he still gazed at her glass.
Her anger came through to her face.
Liquor makes me sick, she said.
I never drink it.
It poisons me.
Adam continued to smile at her.
Her rage was rising beyond her control.
You don’t trust me very much, she said.
No, I don’t.
I will not drink any more, she said in panic.
You don’t have to, Adam said.
I’ll just finish this and go along.
You can forget me now.
But you said you had already.
I came up to Sam Hamilton’s funeral, he said.
That was a fine man.
I’ll miss him.
Do you remember, Cathy, he helped you with the twins?
In Kate the liquor raged.
What’s the matter?
I told you it poisoned me.
I told you it made me sick.
I couldn’t take the chance, he calmly said.
You shot me once.
I don’t know what else you’ve done.
What do you mean?
I’ve heard some scandal, he said.
Just dirty scandal.
She snatched the bottle and filled her glass.
Adam had to get up to pour his own.
A feeling completely foreign to him had arisen.
He was enjoying what he saw in her.
He liked to see her struggling.
Now I must be careful, he told himself.
Don’t talk, don’t talk.
I’ll miss him.
I hated him, she said.
I would have killed him if I could.
He was kind to us.
He looked—he looked into me.
He looked into me too, and he helped me.
I hate him, she said.
I’m glad he’s dead.
Her lip curled.
You are a fool, she said.
I don’t hate you.
You’re just a weak fool.
Sit there and grin, she cried.
You think you’re free, don’t you?
A few drinks and you think you’re a man!
I know you, she said.
I know your cowardly heart.
Adam went on smiling.
The bottle neck chattered against her glass.
When I was hurt I needed you, she said.
But you were slop.
Take that ugly smirk off your face.
I wonder what it is you hate so much.
You wonder, do you?
Her caution was almost entirely gone.
It isn’t hatred, it’s contempt.
And they weren’t good.
I knew them.
I could make them do whatever I wanted.
I could always make people do what I wanted.
When I was half-grown I made a man kill himself.
But you say he killed himself.
He must have been very sorry about something.
He was a fool, said Kate.
I heard him come to the door and beg.
I laughed all night.
You’re a fool too.
I remember how they talked.
Isn’t she a pretty little thing, so sweet, so dainty?
And no one knew me.
Adam drained his glass.
He felt remote and inspective.
He said, It doesn’t matter whether you liked Sam Hamilton.
I found him wise.
He was a liar and a hypocrite too.
Kate spat out her words.
That’s what I hate, the liars, and they’re all liars.
That’s what it is.
I love to show them up.
I love to rub their noses in their own nastiness.
Adam’s brows went up.
That’s exactly what I mean.
I don’t believe it, Adam said quietly.
You don’t believe it!
You don’t believe it!
She mimicked him.
Would you like me to prove it?
You can’t, he said.
Take a look at those, she said.
I don’t want to.
I’ll show you anyway.
She took out a photograph.
That’s a state senator.
He thinks he’s going to run for Congress.
Look at his fat stomach.
He’s got bubs like a woman.
He likes whips.
That streak there—that’s a whip mark.
Look at the expression on his face!
You don’t believe!
Look at this!
This is a professor at Berkeley.
And look at this!
We give it to him now another way.
See that lighted match under his skinny flank?
I don’t want to see these, said Adam.
Well, you have seen them.
And you don’t believe it!
I’ll have you begging to get in here.
I’ll have you screaming at the moon.
Her rage congealed to poison.
No one has ever escaped, she said softly.
Aren’t you in danger?
Do you think I’m a child?
Not any more, said Adam.
Maybe you’ve struck it, she said.
Do you think I want to be human?
Look at those pictures!
I’d rather be a dog than a human.
But I’m not a dog.
I’m smarter than humans.
Nobody can hurt me.
Don’t worry about danger.
She waved at the filing cabinets.
No, they won’t hurt me.
That wouldn’t make any difference, she said.
She leaned closer to him.
In a few years I’ll be going away.
She leaned back in her chair, laughing.
He looked closely at her.
Her face and her laughter were childlike and innocent.
The bottle was nearly empty.
I know what you hate.
You hate something in them you can’t understand.
You don’t hate their evil.
You hate the good in them you can’t get at.
I wonder what you want, what final thing.
I’ll have all the money I need, she said.
I’ll go to New York and I won’t be old.
I’m not old.
Adam stamped on the floor impatiently.
Nonsense, he said.
This isn’t true.
This is crazy.
None of this is true.
I don’t believe any of it.
She said, Do you remember when you first saw me?
His face darkened.
Oh, Lord, yes!
I don’t want to remember.
And after that—there will be other pleasures.
I have to go, Adam said.
She said, Don’t go, dear.
Don’t go now, my love.
My sheets are silk.
I want you to feel those sheets against your skin.
You don’t mean that?
Oh, I do, my love.
You aren’t clever at love, but I can teach you.
I will teach you.
Her face seemed fresh and young.
He moved away in revulsion.
I don’t understand, he said.
I know, but I can’t believe.
I know I won’t believe it in the morning.
It will be a nightmare dream.
But no, it—it can’t be a dream—no.
Because I remember you are the mother of my boys.
You haven’t asked about them.
You are the mother of my sons.
Her eyes were bright with triumph.
Her voice was mockingly soft.
A fool always leaves an opening, she said.
I discovered that when I was a child.
I am the mother of your sons.
Adam’s mouth dropped open.
Cathy, what do you mean?
My name is Kate, she said.
Listen, my darling, and remember.
You were hurt, he said.
You were terribly hurt.
Once, said Kate, just once.
The pregnancy made you ill, he protested.
It was hard on you.
She smiled at him sweetly.
I wasn’t too hurt for your brother.
Have you forgotten Charles?
You are a devil, he said.
I don’t care what you believe, she said.
Adam said, I don’t believe it.
At first you will wonder, and then you’ll be unsure.
You’ll think back about Charles—all about him.
I could have loved Charles.
He was like me in a way.
He was not.
You’ll remember, she said.
You took my medicine by mistake—remember?
Slept as you had never slept before and awakened late—thick-headed?
You were too hurt to plan a thing like that.
I can do anything, she said.
And now, my love, take off your clothes.
And I will show you what else I can do.
He opened his eyes and shook his head violently.
It wouldn’t matter—even if it were true, he said.
It wouldn’t matter at all.
Let me help you take off your coat.
He moved unsteadily toward the door.
Uncontrolled hatred shone in Kate’s eyes.
She screamed, a long and shrill animal screech.
Adam stopped and turned toward her.
The door banged open.
Adam crashed to the floor.
Kate screamed, The boots!
Give him the boots!
He noticed Adam’s open eyes staring up at him.
He turned nervously to Kate.
Her voice was cold.
I said give him the boots.
Break his face!
Ralph said, He ain’t fighting back.
The fight’s all out of him.
Kate sat down.
She breathed through her mouth.
Her hands writhed in her lap.
Adam, she said, I hate you.
I hate you now for the first time.
I hate you!
Adam, are you listening?
I hate you!
Adam tried to sit up, fell back, and tried again.
Sitting on the floor, he looked up at Kate.
It doesn’t matter, he said.
It doesn’t matter at all.
It was so strong that it took quite a killing.
You’ll come crawling back, she said.
You’ll drag your belly on the floor—begging, begging!
You want the boots now, Miss Kate?
She did not answer.
His hand fumbled at the doorjamb.
Kate called, Adam!
He turned slowly.
Kate sat staring at the door.
Her eyes were desolate.
He was not conscious of any thought at all.
Out of the gray throbbing an ecstasy arose.
Will’s stomach was beginning to fill out richly.
Adam sat down.
I don’t know whether I offered my condolences, he said.
It’s a sad time, said Will.
You were at the funeral?
Yes, said Adam.
He gave me things I will never forget.
He was respected, said Will.
I can’t think of him dead.
He seems maybe more alive to me than before.
To Will, Samuel was dead.
I think of things he said, Adam went on.
That’s true, said Will.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Are you going back to your place?
Yes, I am.
I guess I deserved that, he said.
Maybe your father is responsible for a change in me.
How do you mean?
I don’t know as I could explain it.
Anyway, let’s talk about a car.
I’ll give you the straight dope on it, said Will.
Why, I’ve got a list of people who want them.
Is that so?
I’d be glad to do that, Mr.
Trask, and— He paused.
That’s kind of you, said Adam.
How would you like to arrange it?
How do you mean?
Isn’t it more expensive that way?
Well, there’s interest and carrying charge.
Some people find it convenient.
I think I’ll pay cash, said Adam.
There’d be no point in putting it off.
Not very many people feel that way, he said.
I’d never thought of that, said Adam.
You will put me on the list though?
Will leaned toward him.
The first car that comes in, you’re going to have.
I’ll be glad to do it for you, said Will.
Adam asked, How is your mother holding up?
She’s a remarkable woman, he said.
She’s like a rock.
My father wasn’t very practical.
She’s a fine woman, Adam said.
Not only fine.
She stands on her two feet.
She’s a tower of strength.
Did you come back to Olive’s house after the funeral?
No, I didn’t.
Well over a hundred people did.
Yes, she did.
And when you think—it was her own husband.
A remarkable woman, Adam repeated Will’s phrase.
She’ll be all right, Will said.
I don’t have to worry any more.
She’s out of me.
Oh, Christ Almighty, I’m free!
He was glad to be going home.
I’m free, she’s gone, he chanted aloud.
How are the boys?
I’m not keeping the pan hot though.
Everything all right here?
How was the funeral?
Lots of people, Adam said.
He had lots of friends.
I can’t get it through my head that he’s gone.
We’re a practical people and always a little hungry.
But our devils aren’t very bright.
We can outthink them.
That’s some progress.
It would have interested him.
He noticed that Lee was staring at him.
I want to talk to you.
Then he went to the living room.
And it was all new to him.
I got drunk last night.
Lee said, You drunk?
I can hardly believe it.
Well, I was.
And I want to talk about it.
I saw you looking at me.
Is that the same one we named the twins with?
Yes, it is.
Lee poured the scalding green tea.
He said, I went down to see her.
I thought you might, said Lee.
Maybe I wasn’t a human man.
I thought of that too.
How was she?
Adam said slowly, I can’t understand it.
Did you get drunk afterward?
No, before and during.
I needed it for courage, I guess.
You look all right now.
I am all right, said Adam.
That’s what I want to talk to you about.
Maybe that’s what immortality is.
I seemed to come out of a sleep, said Adam.
In some strange way my eyes have cleared.
A weight is off me.
You even use words that sound like Mr.
Hamilton, said Lee.
I’ll build a theory for my immortal relatives.
I’m free, he said.
I have to tell it to someone.
I can live with my boys.
I might even see a woman.
Do you know what I’m saying?
Yes, I know.
A man can’t lie about a thing like that.
You’ll like the boys, I think.
Well, at least I’m going to give myself a chance.
Will you give me another drink and some more tea?
Lee poured the tea and picked up his cup.
Lee was smiling inwardly.
And there was a red irritated rim around his eyes.
Maybe if you’re free, you can free me.
What do you mean, Lee?
Could you let me go?
Why, of course you can go.
Aren’t you happy here?
Adam said, Call it that then.
Aren’t you contented here?
What do you want to do?
Well, one thing it’s too late for.
You’re not too old.
Oh, I guess I’m physically able to father a child.
That’s not what I’m thinking.
I’m too closely married to a quiet reading lamp.
You know, Mr.
Trask, once I had a wife.
She was good company in my little room.
She was very pretty and she made coquettish little jokes.
And I wouldn’t want to make her sad or lonely.
So there’s my first plan gone.
What was the other?
I talked to Mr.
Hamilton about that.
Adam said, Are you making this up?
I would like to die there.
Then he said, Funny.
Of course you can go if you want to.
I’ll even lend you money for your bookstore.
Oh, I have the money.
I’ve had it a long time.
I never thought of your going, Adam said.
I took you for granted.
He straightened his shoulders.
Could you wait a little while?
You wouldn’t lay a trap for me?
My wish isn’t as strong as it once was.
Please try not to need me.
That’s the worst bait of all to a lonely man.
Adam said, A lonely man.
Hamilton knew, said Lee.
We’re controlled, we Chinese, he said.
We show no emotion.
I loved Mr.
Do anything you want, said Adam.
God knows you’ve done enough for me.
I want to scatter devil papers, Lee said.
The rabbit sat perfectly still and his eyes grew large.
From the willow two crouching boys crept.
The boys moved cautiously, bending low, self-consciously toeing-in like Indians.
Aron looked down and said nothing.
I’m going to say you did it, Cal went on.
I won’t take credit.
And I’ll say it was a hard shot.
Well, it was, said Aron.
Well, I’m telling you.
I’ll give you credit to Lee and to Father.
Tell you what.
Don’t you want credit?
Cal asked subtly.
Well, not full credit.
We could divide it up.
After all, it was my arrow, said Cal.
No, it wasn’t.
You look at the feathers.
See that nick?
How did it get in my quiver?
I don’t remember any nick.
Maybe you don’t remember.
But I’m going to give you credit anyway.
Aron said gratefully, No, Cal.
I don’t want that.
We’ll say we both shot at once.
Well, if that’s what you want.
But suppose Lee sees it was my arrow?
We’ll just say it was in my quiver.
You think he’ll believe that?
He’ll think you’re lying.
I just wanted you to know, said Cal.
Just in case he’d think that.
He put the arrow in his quiver.
You can carry him, he said magnanimously.
We ought to start back, said Aron.
Maybe Father is back by now.
It’s too cold at night, Cal.
Don’t you remember how you shivered this morning?
It’s not too cold for me, said Cal.
I never feel cold.
You did this morning.
No, I didn’t.
Do you want to call me a liar?
No, said Aron.
I don’t want to fight.
Afraid to fight?
I just don’t want to.
Then you’re scared, aren’t you?
I guess so.
Aron wandered slowly away, leaving the rabbit on the ground.
His hair was fine and golden.
He was puzzled—but he was often puzzled.
Cal was an enigma to him.
Cal looked more like Adam.
His hair was dark brown.
The fingers were short and slender, the nails delicate.
Cal protected his hands.
He called, Aron, wait for me!
Don’t be mad with me.
You always want to fight, said Aron.
No, I don’t.
I was only making a joke.
Look—you can carry the rabbit.
And we’ll start back now if you want.
Aron smiled at last.
Aron’s right trouser leg was well bloodied from the rabbit.
Cal said, They’ll be surprised we got a rabbit.
If Father’s home, let’s give it to him.
He likes a rabbit for his supper.
All right, Aron said happily.
Tell you what.
All right, if you want to, said Cal.
Yes, but when he dies it’s going to be ours.
This was a new thought to Aron.
What do you mean, when he dies?
Everybody dies, said Cal.
Oh, yes, Aron said.
Yes, he died.
He couldn’t connect the two—the dead Mr.
Hamilton and the live father.
I know that.
Cal said, I know a secret.
What is it?
No, I wouldn’t, if you said not.
I don’t know if I ought.
Tell me, Aron begged.
You won’t tell?
No, I won’t.
Cal said, Where do you think our mother is?
No, she isn’t.
She is too.
She ran away, said Cal.
I heard some men talking.
They were liars.
She ran away, said Cal.
You won’t tell I told you?
I don’t believe it, said Aron.
Father said she was in Heaven.
I’ll bring her back.
Where did the men.
say she is?
I don’t know, but I’ll find her.
She’s in Heaven, said Aron.
Why would Father tell a lie?
He looked at his brother, begging him silently to agree.
Cal didn’t answer him.
Don’t you think she’s in Heaven with the angels?
Just some men.
In the post office at King City.
They didn’t think I could hear.
But I got good ears.
Lee says I can hear the grass grow.
Aron said, What would she want to run away for?
How do I know?
Maybe she didn’t like us.
Aron inspected this heresy.
No, he said.
The men were liars.
Father said she’s in Heaven.
Maybe that’s because she ran away.
I asked Lee.
Know what Lee said?
Lee said, Your mother loved you and she still does.
And Lee gave me a star to look at.
Do you think Lee is a liar?
There were no tears in Cal’s eyes.
Cal felt pleasantly excited.
Nothing could hurt him and nothing could stop him.
And his nostrils had flared then.
Cal put his new tool away.
He made his decision almost too late.
Cal jumped back and cried, I was just joking.
Honest, Aron, it was only a joke.
Pain and puzzlement were on his face.
I won’t do it any more, he said.
The boys trudged along silently for a while.
The light of day began to withdraw.
Going to storm, he said.
Going to be a bastard.
Aron said, Did you really hear those men?
Maybe I only thought I did, Cal said quickly.
Jesus, look at that cloud!
Aron turned around to look at the black monster.
They could smell the sweet odor of ozone.
Running, they sniffed the thunder smell.
The rain fell in sheets and in columns.
There was no reason to run for cover.
They looked at each other and laughed for joy.
Both boys leaned over and laughed hysterically.
Somebody’s here, said Cal.
Will you look at that rig?
It was a woman’s voice.
These boys had had very little experience with women.
Who do you ’spose it is?
An emotion like a light had burst in Aron.
He wanted to shout, Maybe it’s our mother.
Maybe she’s come back.
He said, I don’t know.
I’m going to put on dry clothes.
Lilly boy peek?
You’d better go in.
Aron whispered hoarsely, Who else is there?
Just some people going by.
The rain drove them in.
Adam cried, Come in, boys!
Come on in!
That was enough for one day, but it wasn’t all.
She wore a blue-checked sunbonnet with lace around the front.
These are my boys, their father said.
That’s Aron and this is Caleb.
Boys, shake hands with our guests.
He stole a glance at the lady.
She was smiling, her lips parted.
The room seemed crushed with silence.
And then Aron heard a ripping snicker from Cal.
It was as soft as a handful of petals.
He felt a pleasure that burned him.
Adam and his guests laughed.
Adam said, Mr.
Bacon nearly got caught in the rain.
We were lucky to be lost here, Mr.
I was looking for the Long ranch.
Adam continued to the boys, Mr.
Bacojti is a county supervisor.
Bacon, and he too addressed the boys.
My daughter’s name is Abra, boys.
Isn’t that a funny name?
He used the tone adults employ with children.
Look up, dear.
Abra did not move.
Her hands were again clasped in her lap.
He didn’t mean funny that way, Mrs.
He only meant curious.
Dear, shouldn’t we be going?
Adam said eagerly, Oh, don’t go yet, ma’am.
Lee is making some tea.
It will warm you up.
Well, how pleasant!
Go outside and play.
In the living room Mr.
Bacon crossed his legs.
You have a fine prospect here, he said.
Is it a sizable piece?
Adam said, I have a good strip.
I cross the river to the other side.
It’s a good piece.
That’s all yours across the county road then?
Yes, it is.
I’m kind of ashamed to admit it.
I’ve let it go badly.
I haven’t farmed it at all.
Maybe I got too much farming as a child.
He said, I guess I’m a lazy man.
It was not laziness if he was a rich man.
Only the poor were lazy.
Just as only the poor were ignorant.
Who takes care of the boys?
Adam became a little irritated with the questioning.
I only have one man, he said shortly.
You mean the Chinese we saw?
Bacon was shocked.
Adam smiled at her.
But didn’t they ever have a woman’s care?
No, they didn’t.
The poor lambs, she said.
They’re wild but I guess they’re healthy, Adam said.
I guess we’ve all gone wild like the land.
But now Lee is going away.
I don’t know what we’ll do.
Have you thought about the education of your sons?
No—I guess I haven’t thought about it much.
Bacon said, My husband is a believer in education.
Education is the key to the future, Mr.
What kind of education?
Bacon went on, All things come to men who know.
Yes, I’m a believer in the torch of learning.
He leaned close and his voice became confidential.
Lee made a great stir coming in with the tea.
Lee tried to catch Adam’s eye but could not.
Adam was studying the rug between his feet.
Through his memory Mrs.
Bacon’s voice droned on.
Adam felt the pack loaded with rocks.
Suddenly Adam wanted to see Charles.
He would take a trip—take the boys.
He slapped his leg with excitement.
Bacon paused in his talk.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, I’m sorry, Adam said.
I just remembered something I’ve neglected to do.
Both Bacons were patiently, politely waiting for his explanation.
Adam thought, Why not?
I’m not running for supervisor.
I’m not on the school board.
They shuddered under his statement and exchanged glances.
Lee had been refilling the teacups.
The Bacons didn’t want to comment on the incident.
They wanted to be alone to discuss it.
Lee anticipated that it would be this way.
Aron said, That lady told us the rain was stopped.
Abra answered him wisely.
She didn’t look.
When she’s talking she never looks.
Cal demanded, How old are you?
Ten, going on eleven, said Abra.
We’re eleven, going on twelve.
Abra pushed her sunbonnet back.
It framed her head like a halo.
She was pretty, with dark hair in two braids.
But two features would be with her always.
Her hazel eyes were sharp and intelligent and completely fearless.
I don’t believe you’re twins, she said.
You don’t look alike.
We are too, said Cal.
We are too, said Aron.
Some twins don’t look alike, Cal insisted.
Lots of them don’t, Aron said.
Lee told us how it is.
If the lady has one egg, the twins look alike.
If she has two eggs, they don’t.
We’re two eggs, said Cal.
Eggs, she said.
Which one of you is fried?
And which one is poached?
The boys exchanged uneasy glances.
This was new to them, exciting and frightening.
Cal said, Lee is a Chinaman.
Oh, well, said Abra kindly, why don’t you say so?
She paused to let her shaft sink in.
She saw opposition, struggle, disappear.
Abra had taken control.
She was the boss.
It leaks a little but it’s nice.
The ’dobe house had entered its second decay.
And the deep windows with their rebuilt sashes remained glassless.
Back in the big sala the twins faced their guest.
Do you like it?
Aron asked softly because of the echo.
Yee-es, she admitted hesitantly.
Sometimes we play here, Cal said boldly.
I’ll give you my rabbit, said Cal suddenly.
He hardly even kicked.
Aron looked at him in outrage.
It’s a pretty big one.
I go to real funerals, said Abra.
Went to one yesterday.
There was flowers high as this roof.
Don’t you want our rabbit?
Also, she wanted to touch Aron, and she did.
If you put it in a box, she said.
She felt kindly toward these boys.
She drew on her fairy tales.
You poor children, she said, does your father beat you?
They shook their heads.
They were interested but bewildered.
Are you very poor?
How do you mean?
She avoided that by continuing.
We don’t have a stepmother, said Cal.
We don’t have any kind, said Aron.
Our mother’s dead.
Little motherless orphans, she said sweetly.
I’ll be your mother.
I’ll hold you and rock you and tell you stories.
We’re too big, said Cal.
We’d overset you.
Abra looked away from his brutality.
Aron, she saw, was caught up in her story.
We don’t remember, said Aron.
We were too little.
Well, where is she buried?
You could put flowers on her grave.
We always do that for Grandma and Uncle Albert.
We don’t know, said Aron.
I’ll go with you, said Abra.
I can make a wreath.
I’ll show you how.
She noticed that Aron had not spoken.
Don’t you want to make a wreath?
Yes, he said.
She had to touch him again.
She patted his shoulder and then touched his cheek.
Your mama will like that, she said.
Even in Heaven they look down and notice.
My father says they do.
He knows a poem about it.
Aron said, I’ll go wrap up the rabbit.
I’ve got the box my pants came in.
He ran out of the old house.
Cal watched him go.
He was smiling.
What are you laughing at?
Oh, nothing, he said.
Cal’s eyes stayed on her.
She tried to stare him down.
He had done it since he first discovered he could.
It was the strongest, purest emotion he knew.
Cal’s reaction was automatic.
Few are content with their age.
Abra wanted to be an adult.
He could see in his mind what would happen.
And meanwhile Cal knew he was beginning to win.
This, he knew, could make even an adult nervous.
Abra couldn’t stand it.
She said, See anything green?
Cal asked, Do you go to school?
Of course I do.
How old are you?
Going on eleven.
What’s wrong with that?
He didn’t answer her.
Come on, tell me!
What’s wrong with that?
Still no answer.
Look, the rain’s stopped.
Cal said, I guess he’s looking around for it.
You mean, for the rabbit?
He’s got that all right—it’s dead.
But maybe he can’t catch the other.
It gets away.
What gets away?
He wouldn’t want me to tell, said Cal.
He wants it to be a surprise.
He caught it last Friday.
It bit him too.
Whatever are you talking about?
You’ll see, said Cal, when you open the box.
This was not a guess.
Cal knew his brother.
She began to hate this boy.
She retired into silence.
I think I’ll go back, she said.
Wait, said Cal.
She turned as he came up with her.
What do you want?
she asked coldly.
Don’t be mad with me, he said.
You don’t know what goes on here.
You should see my brother’s back.
His change of pace bewildered her.
His voice was low and secret.
She lowered her voice to match his.
What do you mean?
What’s wrong with his back?
All scars, said Cal.
It’s the Chinaman.
She shivered and tensed with interest.
What does he do?
Does he beat him?
Worse than that, said Cal.
Why don’t you tell your father?
We don’t dare.
Do you know what would happen if we told?
He shook his head.
No—he seemed to think carefully—I don’t even dare tell you.
Cal said, I can’t tell you now.
The Chinaman would know if I told.
Bacon called, Abra!
Lee held the restive horse while Mrs.
Bacon was helped up into the rig.
He thrust it at Abra.
Here, he said.
Don’t untie it until you get home.
Cal saw revulsion on Abra’s face.
Her hands shrank away from the box.
Take it, dear, her father said.
Hurry, we’re very late.
He thrust the box into her hands.
Cal stepped close to her.
I want to whisper, he said.
He put his mouth to her ear.
You’ve wet your pants, he said.
She blushed and pulled the sunbonnet up over her head.
I wanted to marry her, Aron said.
I put a letter in the box, asking her.
Don’t be sad, said Cal.
I’m going to let you use my rifle.
Aron’s head jerked around.
You haven’t got a rifle.
Haven’t I though?
He was a cloud of a father.
The change made them timid.
Adam said, I hear you were hunting today.
After a pause Aron admitted, Yes, sir.
Did you get anything?
This time a longer pause, and then, Yes, sir.
What did you get?
With bows and arrows?
Who got him?
Aron said, We both shot.
We don’t know which one hit.
Adam said, Don’t you know your own arrows?
This time Aron refused to answer and get into trouble.
What makes you think that?
I don’t know, Cal said.
But I think it was Aron hit the rabbit.
Adam swung his eyes.
And what do you think?
I think maybe I hit it—but I’m not sure.
Well, you both seem to handle the situation very well.
The alarm went out of the faces of the boys.
It did not seem to be a trap.
Where is the rabbit?
Cal said, Aron gave it to Abra as a present.
She threw it out, said Aron.
I don’t know.
I wanted to marry her too.
How about you, Cal?
I guess I’ll let Aron have her, said Cal.
Is she a nice little girl?
Oh, yes, said Aron.
She’s nice, all right.
She’s good and nice.
Ready to go to bed?
he asked the boys.
They glared in protest.
Adam said, Sit down and let them stay a while.
I’ve got the accounts together.
We can go over them later, said Lee.
What accounts, Lee?
The house and ranch accounts.
You said you wanted to know where you stood.
Not the accounts for over ten years, Lee!
You never wanted to be bothered before.
I guess that’s right.
But sit a while.
Are they engaged?
I don’t think she’s accepted him yet, said Adam.
That may give us some time.
He made his decision.
She’s a real nice girl, he said.
I like her.
Could we, Father?
She said she would teach us how to make wreaths.
Adam’s mind raced.
Adam said, I wish we could do that, boys.
But I’ll have to tell you.
How did she get there?
It’s the same with us, he said.
I know that, said Aron.
You told us that before.
Sure you did, said Cal.
He was vaguely disappointed.
Adam quickly changed the subject.
Bacon made a suggestion this afternoon, he began.
I’d like you boys to think about it.
The thought stunned the twins.
Cal asked, How about here?
Aron said, Abra lives in Salinas.
And that was enough for Aron.
Already he had forgotten the sailing box.
Adam said, Well, you think about it.
Maybe you should go to bed now.
Why didn’t you go to school today?
The teacher’s sick, said Aron.
Lee verified it.
Miss Gulp has been sick for three days, he said.
They don’t have to go back until Monday.
Come on, boys.
They followed him obediently from the room.
Adam said, Do they know anything?
I don’t know, said Lee.
Well, maybe it was just the little girl.
Here are the accounts.
Every year has a rubber band around it.
I’ve been over it.
You mean all accounts?
You wanted to know how you stood.
Here it is—all of it.
Do you really think you’ll move?
Well, I’m thinking of it.
Have you thought of the other danger?
What do you mean?
Well, suppose they find out the truth.
Plenty of people know.
I don’t believe that, said Lee.
But that’s not the worst danger.
I guess I don’t follow you, Lee.
It’s the lie I’m thinking of.
It might infect everything.
They wouldn’t believe anything then.
Yes, I see.
But what can I tell them?
I couldn’t tell them the whole truth.
I’ll have to think about that, Lee.
I’ll have to think about it.
I’m glad he told me though.
I wouldn’t like not to know.
Do you want to tell me?
No, I don’t want to.
But I do know.
Yes, there’s the trouble.
It’s bound to be all truth or part lie.
Well, I can’t force you.
I’ll think about it, said Adam.
What’s the story about your mother?
You really want to hear?
Only if you want to tell me.
I’ll make it very short, said Lee.
All right then.
I’ll tell you— And Lee looked back in time.
He starts every year clean.
There are no excuses.
That’s not a bad idea, said Adam.
Well, good or bad, that’s the way it was.
My father had some bad luck.
He could not pay a debt.
The family met and discussed the situation.
Ours is an honorable family.
All of this was reasonable and honorable.
There was only one black sorrow.
And you can imagine what those holes were like.
She moved her mat close to my father.
Well, there it was.
They were condemned to hard labor for five years.
But you don’t know the background.
Yes, said Adam.
But there’s one thing I don’t understand.
How could a woman do that kind of work?
asked, Now what did you want to know?
How could your mother do a man’s work?
I guess a loving woman is almost indestructible.
Adam made a wry grimace.
Lee said, You’ll see one day, you’ll see.
I didn’t mean to think badly, said Adam.
How could I know out of one experience?
Adam cried, She wasn’t pregnant!
She was pregnant, said Lee.
Did she know about it when she started?
No, she did not.
It’s a longer story than I thought.
Well, you can’t stop now, said Adam.
No, I suppose not.
And only then did she tell my father about me.
They went to work.
Adam said, Were they ignorant?
Surely they would have taken care of her.
I haven’t told you enough.
And that’s why this is so long.
They were not ignorant.
These human cattle were imported for one thing only—to work.
Only males were brought—no females.
The country did not want them breeding.
And then it takes all hell to root them out.
shot and buried her like a diseased cow.
Fifteen men were shot for being a little mutinous.
Why should you not tell me?
I can see my father’s face when he told me.
An old misery comes back, raw and full of pain.
They had no plan.
They did not know what to do.
And then my father figured out a plan.
He stopped smoking to save the matches issued.
I wish I had known her.
So do I, said Adam.
Did you ever tell this to Sam Hamilton?
No I didn’t.
I wish I had.
He loved a celebration of the human soul.
Such things were like a personal triumph to him.
I hope they got there, said Adam.
And my father became very Chinese then.
Get on with it, Adam said irritably.
My father heard the shout Woman’ and he knew.
My father came to her on the pile of shale.
She died on the shale in the afternoon.
Adam was breathing hard.
The whole camp became my mother.
It is a beauty—a dreadful kind of beauty.
And now good night.
I can’t talk any more.
You don’t have any, said Lee.
You haven’t written a word in years.
I’ll lend you mine if you want.
And it was hard.
Adam scratched his head with the penholder.
It’s easier to go than to write, said Lee.
Sure I’ll stay.
I’m going to write.
Why don’t you ask your brother to come out here?
Say, that’s a good idea, Lee.
I didn’t think of it.
Dear brother Charles, it said.
I wonder how this letter finds you.
I trust in good health.
I have two sons and they are twins.
Their mother is not here.
Country life did not agree with her.
Maybe I will do better from now on.
I always did make good resolutions.
But for a number of years I felt poorly.
I am well now.
How are you and how do you prosper?
I would like to see you.
Why don’t you come to visit here?
No cold winters here.
That makes a difference to old men’ like us.
The trip would do you good.
I want to see you.
I suppose many things have happened.
I guess that is the way of the world.
Your brother Adam.
He seized the pen and wrote below his signature, P.
Charles, I never hated you no matter what.
I always loved you because you were my brother.
He sealed the envelope flap with his fist.
he called, Oh, Lee!
The Chinese looked in through the door.
I don’t know, said Lee.
Two weeks maybe.
He forgot how much time had elapsed.
Maybe he’s mad at me for not writing.
But he didn’t write either.
No—he didn’t know where to write.
Maybe he’s moved away.
Lee answered, It’s only been gone a few days.
Give it time.
I wonder whether he would really come out here?
Adam asked himself, and he wondered whether he wanted Charles.
Well, what did you learn today?
You must have learned something.
Did you read?
What did you read?
That old one about the grasshopper and the ant.
Well, that’s interesting.
There’s one about an eagle carries a baby away.
Yes, I remember that one.
I forget what happens.
We aren’t to it yet.
We saw the pictures.
The boys were disgusted.
The bark would slip easily from a twig.
He couldn’t get a peep out of his whistles.
Here she is!
Will called with a false enthusiasm.
Everything else is automatic.
The process used to be more complicated.
Tell you what!
he said brightly.
You see, this isn’t my line.
I wanted you to see her.
and listen to her before I made delivery.
But I just wanted you to see her.
Will had forgotten some of his own instructions.
They wouldn’t have gone.
Of course you will, Adam said without conviction.
I will try to understand it, Lee said.
But drive it I will not.
What’s this do-hickey, Father?
Get your hands off that.
But what’s it for?
I don’t know, but don’t touch it.
You don’t know what might happen.
Didn’t the man tell you?
I don’t remember what he said.
Do you hear me, Cal?
Don’t open that.
By eleven o’clock hysterical nervousness had set in.
He spat and threw the lines at Lee.
Lee and Adam stared at each other.
They had forgotten about the noonday meal.
I’m used to a hot dinner, he said.
Well, he said.
Done any studying?
I didn’t know it was there, said Adam.
Oh, Lord, said the young man disgustedly.
Might as well get started, he said.
Adam said, Mr.
Hamilton couldn’t start it last night.
All right, come along.
Know the principles of a internal combustion engine?
No, said Adam.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
He lifted the tin flaps.
This-here is a internal combustion engine, he said.
Lee said quietly, So young to be so erudite.
The boy swung around toward him, scowling.
What did you say?
Lee spread his hands and smiled blandly.
Say velly smaht fella, he observed quietly.
Mebbe go college.
Just call me Joe!
What do them fellas know?
Can they set a timer, huh?
Can they file a point?
And he spat a brown disparaging comment on the ground.
Adam said, Lee was admiring your grasp of the subject.
Just call me Joe, he said.
I ought to know it.
Went to automobile school in Chicago.
That’s a real school—not like no college.
But not the bad ones, said Lee.
Not no highbinders nor nothing like that.
But good Chinks.
I hope I may be included in that group?
You look like a good Chink to me.
Just call me Joe.
Adam was puzzled at the conversation, but the twins weren’t.
The mechanic became professional again but his tone was kinder.
An amused friendliness took the place of his former contempt.
This-here, he said, is a internal combustion engine.
Operates through the explosion of gases in a enclosed space.
They nodded blankly, afraid to stop the flow.
They’s two kinds, two cycle and four cycle.
This-here is four cycle.
Again they nodded.
The twins, looking up into his face with adoration, nodded.
That’s interesting, said Adam.
He pulled up for a moment, his face showing strain.
The planetary system is, don’t forget, rev-a-lu-shun-ary.
You better study up on it in the book.
He said this in boldface type, capital letters.
Come around here, said the boy.
Now you see that-there?
That’s the ignition key.
When you turn that-there you’re ready to go ahead.
Now, you push this do-hickey to the left.
That puts her on battery—see, where it says Bat.
That means battery.
They craned their necks into the car.
The twins were standing on the running board.
I got ahead of myself.
You push it up—get it?
And this-here’s the gas—you push her down.
I want you to pay attention.
You kids get off the car.
You’re in my light.
Get down, goddam it.
He took a deep breath.
Now you ready?
Spark retarded, gas advanced.
Spark up, gas down.
Now switch to battery—left, remember—left.
A buzzing like that of a gigantic bee sounded.
That’s the contact in one of the coil boxes.
He noticed a look of consternation on Adam’s face.
He moved to the front of the car.
Now watch careful while I show you.
See how my thumb is turned down?
He didn’t look up but he knew they were nodding.
Now, he said, look careful.
Hear that sucking sound?
But don’t pull her too much or you’ll flood her.
there you are.
His listeners were limp.
After all this they had just got the engine started.
The boy kept at them.
Spark up—gas down.
They repeated in chorus, Spark up—gas down.
Switch to Bat.
Switch to Bat.
Crank to compression, thumb down.
Crank to compression, thumb down.
Easy over—choke out.
Easy over—choke out.
Spark down—gas up.
Spark down—gas up.
Switch to Mag.
Switch to Mag.
Now, we’ll go over her again.
Just call me Joe.
Just call you Joe.
Spark up—gas down.
The process seemed silly to him.
The boy looked at the approaching vehicle.
That-there’s got sixteen valves, he said in a reverent tone.
Will leaned out of his car.
How’s it going?
Just fine, said the mechanic.
They catch on quick.
Look, Roy, I’ve got to take you in.
The new hearse knocked out a bearing.
Hawks at eleven tomorrow.
Roy snapped to efficient attention.
Hey, Cal said, I thought your name was Joe.
How do you mean, Joe?
You told us to call you Joe.
Hamilton says you’re Roy.
Roy laughed and jumped into the roadster.
Know why I say call me Joe?
Because my name is Roy.
I will, said Adam.
The little engine roared and then stopped.
Have to keep up with the times, said Adam.
They’ll change the face of the countryside.
They get their clatter into everything, the postmaster went on.
We even feel it here.
Man used to come for his mail once a week.
Now he comes every day, sometimes twice a day.
He just can’t wait for his damn catalogue.
Always running around.
It was a kind of jealousy coming out.
It was the women who put the pressure on.
Social status was involved.
Well, I’ll see you in the hospital, he said viciously.
I wonder what they want?
He looked closely at the envelope.
I wonder how they got my address?
He turned the envelope over and looked at the back.
Lee watched him, smiling.
Maybe the questions are answered in the letter.
I guess so, Adam said.
He read the letter very slowly.
Adam could feel their impatience with him.
The next paragraph began a complete change of mood.
No stone marks his grave.
My brother Charles is dead, he said.
I’m sorry, said Lee.
Cal said, Is he our uncle?
He was your Uncle Charles, said Adam.
I didn’t know we had him, Aron said.
Maybe we can put some flowers on his grave.
Abra would help us.
She likes to.
It’s a long way off—clear across the country.
Aron said excitedly, I know!
He felt that he was growing rich in dead relatives.
Was he nice?
Very nice, said Adam.
Were you twins too?
Cal asked, Was he rich?
Of course not, said Adam.
Where’d you get that idea?
Well, if he was rich we’d get it, wouldn’t we?
We’re sad because he died.
How can I be sad?
I never even saw him.
Your obedient servants, Bellows and Harvey, by George B.
Charles never spent a dime.
He pinched a dollar until the eagle screamed.
Is there an opening out there for a good lawyer?
I mean myself.
Your old friend, Geo.
All three were waiting for him to continue.
Adam’s mouth shut to a line.
I just thought you looked concerned.
I’m sad about my brother.
He couldn’t remember a single procedure.
Lee asked, Want some help?
I can’t remember where to start.
Of course, of course.
I guess we did.
Well, can’t we have something else?
How about bacon and eggs?
You’ll want to mail your answer tomorrow, said Lee.
You can buy meat then.
I guess so, said Adam.
While dinner was preparing Adam sat staring into space.
Cal opened the door and sat behind the wheel.
Come on, get in!
Aron protested, Father told us to stay out of it.
He won’t ever know.
Aron climbed in timidly and eased back in the seat.
Cal turned the wheel from side to side.
Honk, honk, he said, and then, Know what I think?
I think Uncle Charles was rich.
He was not.
I bet you anything he was.
You think our father’d tell a lie.
I won’t say that.
I just bet he was rich.
They were silent for a while.
Cal steered wildly around imaginary curves.
He said, I bet you I can find out.
How do you mean?
What you got to bet?
Nothing, said Aron.
How about your deer’s-leg whistle?
Is it a bet?
I guess so, Aron said vaguely.
I don’t see why.
Cal said, Father will want to talk to Lee.
And I’m going to listen.
You won’t dare.
You think I won’t.
 ’Spose I was to tell.
Cal’s eyes turned cold and his face darkened.
You won’t tell.
Because if you do—I’ll tell who stole his knife.
Nobody stole his knife.
He’s got his knife.
He opened the letter with it.
Cal smiled bleakly.
I mean tomorrow, he said.
He couldn’t do anything about it.
Cal was perfectly safe.
He could outthink and outplan his brother.
He put his arm around Aron.
Aron did not flinch or respond.
He drew back a little to see Cal’s face.
How do you mean?
All the tricky, sneaky things, said Aron.
What do you mean, sneaky?
Well, about the rabbit, and sneaking here in the car.
And you did something to Abra.
Ho, said Cal.
Wouldn’t you like to know!
But he was uneasy.
Aron said slowly.
I wouldn’t want to know that.
I’d like to know why you do it.
You’re always at something.
I just wonder why you do it.
I wonder what’s it good for.
A pain pierced Cal’s heart.
His planning suddenly seemed mean and dirty to him.
He knew that his brother had found him out.
And he felt a longing for Aron to love him.
It’s been a big day.
Cal said, I don’t want it.
Aron said, It’s yours now.
Well, I don’t want it.
I won’t have it.
Aron laid the bone whistle on the table.
It’ll be here for you, he said.
Adam broke in, Say, what is this argument?
I said you boys should go to bed.
Cal put on his little boy face.
It’s too early to go to bed.
Adam said, That wasn’t quite the truth I told you.
I want to talk privately to Lee.
Do you understand?
I wonder what went on there, he said.
How do you mean, Lee?
What were we talking about?
Well, maybe it will come out later, said Lee.
It probably didn’t mean anything.
Yes, it meant something.
Then he said, Mr.
Maybe you’re right, said Adam.
Without that, time would be unarmed against us.
What did you want to talk to me about?
Lee took out his half-glasses and put them on.
He opened the letter under the lamp and read it.
Adam asked, Well?
Is there an opening here for a lawyer?
How do you mean?
Oh, I see.
Are you making a joke?
No, said Lee, I was not making a joke.
Are you speaking sharply to me?
Yes, I am, said Lee.
I’ll lay aside my Oriental manner.
I’m getting old and cantankerous.
I am growing impatient.
I don’t want to hurt your feelings.
They aren’t hurt.
You want to talk about this letter.
I don’t understand it, said Adam helplessly.
Well, you knew your brother.
It’s a long time ago, Adam said.
Before I went into the army.
Lee leaned close to the picture.
It’s hard to make out.
He hadn’t any, said Adam.
He never laughed.
Well, that wasn’t exactly what I meant.
Did he like you?
I don’t know, said Adam.
Sometimes I thought he loved me.
He tried to kill me once.
Did he know your wife?
Did he love her?
He hated her.
It doesn’t really matter.
That’s not your problem, is it?
That’s what I want.
Go ahead then.
I can’t seem to get my mind to work clearly.
The uninvolved can sometimes do that.
That’s what I want.
Very well then.
He held his round chin in his thin small hand.
I didn’t think of that.
Adam stirred uneasily.
Is that opium?
No, said Lee.
Why do you smoke it then?
I don’t know, said Lee.
Not very complicated.
Lee’s eyelids half closed.
That is a great deal of money.
Courts always try to follow the wishes of the testator.
My brother would not want that, said Adam.
Maybe you’ll have to think for your brother, said Lee.
What your wife is doing is neither good nor bad.
Saints can spring from any soil.
Maybe with this money she would do some fine thing.
There’s no springboard to philanthropy like a bad conscience.
It was closer to murder than to charity.
You don’t think she should have the money then?
She said she would destroy many reputable men in Salinas.
She can do it too.
I see, said Lee.
I’m glad I can take a detached view of this.
The pants of their reputations must have some thin places.
Morally, then, you would be against giving her the money?
Well, consider this.
She has no name, no background.
A whore springs full blown from the earth.
I guess that’s so.
It’s a very delicate moral problem, he said.
I’m sure they will get some interesting results.
He laid his pipe on the table.
But you don’t have any choice, do you?
What do you mean by that?
Well, do you?
Do you know yourself so much less than I do?
I don’t know what to do, said Adam.
I’ll have to give it a lot of thought.
Lee said angrily, I guess I’ve been wasting my time.
Are you lying to yourself or only to me?
Don’t speak to me like that!
I have always disliked deception.
Your course is drawn.
I’ll speak any way I want to.
I feel sand under my skin.
Faced with two sets of morals, you’ll follow your training.
What you call thinking won’t change it.
Adam got to his feet.
His face was angry.
Lee sighed deeply.
He walked wearily to the front door and opened it.
He turned back and smiled at Adam.
A gray, quilted melancholy descended on him.
Dear Lord, he said, let me be like Aron.
Don’t make me mean.
I don’t want to be.
I don’t want to be mean.
I don’t want to be lonely.
For Jesus’ sake, Amen.
Slow warm tears were running down his cheeks.
Aron whispered from his pillow in the dark, You’re cold.
You’ve got a chill.
He asked softly, Did Uncle Charles have any money?
No, said Cal.
Well, you were out there long enough.
What did Father want to talk about?
Cal lay still, trying to control his breathing.
Don’t you want to tell me?
I don’t care if you don’t tell me.
I’ll tell, Cal whispered.
Father is going to send a wreath to our mother.
A great big goddam wreath of carnations.
How’s he going to get it clear there?
On the train.
Don’t talk so loud.
Aron dropped back to a whisper.
But how’s it going to keep fresh?
With ice, said Cal.
They’re going to pack ice all around it.
Aron asked, Won’t it take a lot of ice?
A whole hell of a lot of ice, said Cal.
Go to sleep now.
It will, said Cal.
Adam said, I guess I was stupid.
Lee leaned on his spading fork and regarded him quietly.
When are you going?
I thought I would catch the two-forty.
Then I can get the eight o’clock back.
I’ve thought of that.
Would you write a letter?
I’m the stupid one there.
I have to go, said Adam.
Well, good luck.
I’ll be interested to hear what she says and does.
I’ll take the rig, said Adam.
I’ll leave it at the stable in King City.
I’m nervous about driving the Ford alone.
Her dress was severe.
What do you want now?
The Finn stood behind Adam.
Adam did not reply.
Go out and close the door, she told the Finn.
Adam sat at the table beside her.
No, you haven’t got a joke in you.
Your brother might be joking.
You sure he’s dead?
All I have is the letter, said Adam.
What do you want me to do about it?
Adam shrugged his shoulders.
What do you want?
Adam drew his finger slowly around his black ribbon hatband.
What have you told them about me?
Nothing, said Adam.
He was dead when the letter got there.
The letter went to the lawyers.
It tells about it.
What have you written him?
I haven’t answered the letter yet.
What do you intend to say when you answer it?
The same thing—that you live in another town.
You can’t say we’ve been divorced.
We haven’t been.
I don’t intend to.
I’ll take forty-five thousand in cash.
What do you mean—no?
You can’t bargain.
I’m not bargaining.
Do what you want.
What makes you so cocky?
I feel safe.
She peered at him from under the green transparent eyeshade.
Adam, you’re a fool.
I know that.
You know it?
You’re a damn fool if you thought that.
Adam said patiently, I don’t care what you do.
She smiled cynically at him.
You don’t, huh?
Does that tempt you?
Tempt me to do what?
To get me floated and take all the money.
I brought you the letter, Adam said patiently.
I want to know why.
Charles left you the money in his will.
He didn’t put any strings on it.
And then she said, What am I thinking about?
You’re not smart.
Who’s advising you?
How about that Chinaman?
He gave me no advice.
Adam was interested in his own complete lack of emotion.
He didn’t really feel that he was here at all.
Kate was afraid—she was afraid of him.
She controlled her face and whipped the fear from it.
You’re just doing it because you’re honest, is that it?
You’re just too sugar sweet to live.
I hadn’t thought of it, Adam said.
It’s your money and I’m not a thief.
It doesn’t matter to me what you think about it.
Kate pushed the eyeshade back on her head.
Well, I’ll find out what you’re up to.
Don’t think I won’t take care of myself.
Did you think I’d take such a stupid bait?
Where do you get your mail?
he asked patiently.
What’s that to you?
Don’t you do it!
I’ll keep this.
I’ll get legal advice.
Don’t think I won’t.
You can drop the innocence now.
You do that, Adam said.
I want you to have what is yours.
Charles willed you the money.
It isn’t mine.
I’ll find the trick.
I’ll find it.
Adam said, I guess you can’t understand it.
I don’t much care.
There are so many things I don’t understand.
He waved his hand to indicate the house.
Who asked you to understand?
Adam stood up and took his hat from the table.
I guess that’s all, he said.
He walked toward the door.
She called after him, You’re changed, Mr.
Have you got a woman at last?
Adam stopped and slowly turned and his eyes were thoughtful.
I said I didn’t understand about you, he said slowly.
Just now it came to me what you don’t understand.
What don’t I understand, Mr.
You know about the ugliness in people.
You showed me the pictures.
You don’t believe I loved you.
She cackled at him derisively.
In sticks and stones.
What a sweet dreamer is Mr.
Give me a sermon, Mr.
I think you are only a part of a human.
I can’t do anything about that.
That would be horrible.
Kate pushed back her chair and stood up.
Our Mouse is a philosopher, she said.
Did you ever hear of hallucinations?
No, I don’t, said Adam.
No, I don’t.
And I don’t think you do either.
Kate sat down and stared at the closed door.
Adam took off his hat.
You don’t know me.
I’m Adam Trask.
Your father was a friend of mine.
I thought I’d like to pay my respects to Mrs.
She helped me with the twins.
We’ve heard about you.
Just a moment.
You see, we’ve made a kind of retreat for Mother.
There’s a friend to see you.
You’ll have to excuse me, she said to Adam.
Catrina’s frying chicken and I have to watch her.
Liza seemed smaller than ever.
Tom had bought the parrot from a sailor.
Come off it, you bastard, said Polly unemotionally.
Liza frowned at him.
Polly, she said sternly, that’s not polite.
Liza ignored the vulgarity.
She held out her tiny hand.
Trask, she said, I’m glad to see you.
Sit down, won’t you?
We got your flowers.
And she remembered, too, every bouquet after all this time.
Adam had sent a fine pillow of everlastings.
It must be hard to rearrange your life.
Liza turned her head away.
How is everything down your way?
Good this year.
Lots of rainfall.
The feed’s deep already.
Tom wrote me, she said.
What brings you up to Salinas, Mr.
Why, some business.
I’m thinking of moving up here.
Thought it might be better for my boys.
They get lonely on the ranch.
We never got lonely on the ranch, she said harshly.
I thought maybe the schools would be better here.
My twins could have the advantages.
Well, I was just thinking about it, he said.
Children raised in the country do better.
Then she centered closely on him.
Are you looking for a house in Salinas?
Well, yes, I guess I am.
Go see my daughter Dessie, she said.
Dessie wants to move back to the ranch with Tom.
I’ll certainly do that, said Adam.
I’ll go now.
I’m glad to see you doing so well.
Thank you, she said.
Adam was moving toward the door when she said, Mr.
Trask, do you ever see my son Tom?
Well, no, I don’t.
You see, I haven’t been off the ranch.
I think he’s lonely.
She stopped as though horrified at this breaking over.
I surely will.
A neatly painted sign was screwed to the front gate.
It read: Dessie Hamilton, Dressmaker.
Adam went in to get some dinner.
Come and sit with me, he called to Adam.
Up on business?
Yes, said Adam.
I went to pay a call on your mother.
Will laid down his fork.
I’m just up here for an hour.
I just didn’t want to disturb them.
Besides, I have to go right back.
Order a rib steak.
They’ve got good ones.
How is Mother?
She’s got great courage, said Adam.
I find I admire her more all the time.
That she has.
Rib steak, medium, said Adam to the waiter.
No—yes, french fried.
Your mother is worried about Tom.
Is he all right?
She’s got reason to worry, he said.
Something’s the matter with Tom.
He’s moping around like a monument.
I guess he depended on Samuel.
Too much, said Will.
Far too much.
He can’t seem to come out of it.
In some ways Tom is a great big baby.
I’ll go and see him.
She can’t do it, he said.
I won’t let her do it.
Will covered up.
Well, he said, she’s got a nice business here.
Makes a good living.
It would be a shame to throw it away.
I’m catching the eight o’clock home, Adam said.
So am I, said Will.
He didn’t want to talk any more.
Dessie was the beloved of the family.
I can put it this way.
Maybe the children and Mr.
Maybe she had read a poem from Chatterbox with gestures.
It didn’t matter.
It was warm-funny, it was catching funny.
That’s how Dessie was and that’s what she could do.
She carried excitement in her arms just as Samuel had.
Dessie was not beautiful.
None of them seemed capable of light or changeable love.
It was much worse than that.
In time the Mrs.
They weren’t disloyal.
Dessie’s business began to fall off.
Times were changing and the ready-made dress was becoming popular.
It was no longer a disgrace to wear one.
Then Samuel died and the world shattered like a dish.
She hadn’t much of any business to sell out.
I forgot something, he said to Adam.
I’ll see you on the train.
When did you get in town?
Business, he said.
Just here between trains.
I want to talk to you.
Have you seen Mother?
I’m just here over trains, he said gruffly.
I was thinking of it.
I don’t want you to go.
She smiled uncertainly.
What’s wrong with that?
Tom’s lonely down there.
You’ve got a nice business here, he said.
I haven’t any business here, she replied.
I thought you knew that.
I don’t want you to go, he repeated sullenly.
My big brother is masterful.
Tell Dessie why not.
It’s too lonely down there.
It won’t be as lonely with the two of us.
Will pulled at his lips angrily.
He blurted, Tom’s not himself.
You shouldn’t be alone with him.
Isn’t he well?
Does he need help?
She smiled affectionately.
Will, you’ve always thought he was strange.
You thought he was strange when he didn’t like business.
That was different.
But now he’s broody.
He doesn’t talk.
He goes walking alone in the hills at night.
Didn’t you ever write poetry, Will?
I did not.
I have, said Dessie.
Pages and pages of it all over the table.
I don’t want you to go.
Let me decide, she said softly.
I’ve lost something.
I want to try to find it again.
You’re talking foolish.
Dear brother, she said, please let me decide.
Tom met Dessie at the King City station.
His red mustache was clipped.
She smiled and walked up behind him.
I beg your pardon, stranger, she said quietly.
Is there a Mister Tom Hamilton here?
He nuzzled her cheek with his harsh mustache.
He said over his shoulder to the telegrapher, Those Hamiltons!
Just look at them!
Tom looked down at her.
Aren’t you Dessie Hamilton?
I seem to remember you.
But you’ve changed.
Where are your pigtails?
It’s a lovely town.
No, she said.
I think I remember it.
Dessie said, Where’s Will?
I don’t know, he answered gruffly.
Did he talk to you?
He said you shouldn’t come.
He told me the same thing, said Dessie.
He got George to write to me too.
Why shouldn’t you come if you want to?
What’s Will got to do with it?
She touched his arm.
He thinks you’re crazy.
Says you’re writing poetry.
Tom’s face darkened.
What’s he want anyway?
He had no right to look at my papers.
Gently, gently, said Dessie.
Will’s your brother.
Don’t forget that.
How would he like me to go through his papers?
He wouldn’t let you, Dessie said dryly.
They’d be locked in the safe.
Now let’s not spoil the day with anger.
All right, he said.
God knows all right!
But he makes me mad.
Dessie changed the subject, forced the change.
Mother wanted to come.
Have you ever seen Mother cry, Tom?
No, not that I can remember.
No, she’s not a crier.
Well, she cried.
Makes me feel I’m well from a sickness.
The horses spanked along the county road.
Tom said, Adam Trask has bought a Ford.
Or maybe I should say Will sold him a Ford.
I didn’t know about the Ford, said Dessie.
He’s buying my house.
Giving me a very good price for it.
I put a very high price on the house.
I was going to come down during negotiations.
Trask accepted the first price.
It put me in a fix.
What did you do, Dessie?
He didn’t seem to care either way.
He’d have you locked up.
But the house wasn’t worth what I asked!
I repeat what I said about Will.
What’s Adam want with your house?
He’s going to move there.
Wants the twins to go to school in Salinas.
What’ll he do with his ranch?
I don’t know.
He didn’t say.
It isn’t such a bad place.
Fine for everything except making a living.
No, I don’t.
But that was the family, not the land.
Mother never let me forget it.
They’d come too, Dessie said.
Let’s do it.
I guess that’s it.
Tom, there’s so much grass.
I’m getting twenty head of stock to eat it.
You must be rich.
I wonder what Will would do.
He’s a scarcity man.
He told me.
He said, Always deal in scarcities.
Dessie said, What’s the card on that mesquite bush?
Tom, you did it!
I did not.
Someone’s been here.
Dessie squealed with delight over each one.
Tom looked sternly ahead of him.
Now who could have done that?
A man can’t leave the place any more.
When that relaxed she felt a soreness like a bruise.
The cooing of pigeons brought memory into the procession.
said, No white pigeons.
Why not white?
Get gray ones.
I like white ones.
Get gray ones,’ he told me.
And as the sky covers me, I’ll get white ones.
Gray ones taste just as good and they’re bigger.
I’ll let no flimsy fairy tale push me, Samuel said.
You’re a mule of contention, a very mule!
Someone’s got to do these things, he said sullenly.
Oh, dear Tom, she said, and her lips moved.
She struggled to get up.
There was so much braid, and here she lay drowsing.
She cried, I’ll get it done, Mollie.
It will be ready.
In the hall they were gone to the bedrooms.
Sadness and death.
The wave receded and left her in dry awakeness.
The whistling scattered a savage melody.
He cascaded the wood into the woodbox.
You’re up, he said.
That was to wake you if you were still sleeping.
His face was lighted with joy.
His joy hardened to fierceness.
Yes, he said loudly.
And we’ll have that time again, right here.
I’ve been dragging myself in misery like a spine-broken snake.
No wonder Will thought I was cracked.
But now you’re back, and I’ll show you.
I’ll breathe life into life again.
Do you hear?
This house is going to be alive.
Nothing, said Tom.
A little twist with the fingers.
Invented—now that’s why I have no time.
You don’t wear stiff collars.
I did yesterday.
That’s when I invented it.
And eggs will come through on a little conveyor belt—here!
I’ll draw it.
I want to draw some breakfast, Dessie said.
What’s the shape of a fried egg?
He pitched wood in and started his high whistling.
What do you think I am?
Why can’t I climb out of my gray ragbag?
I will, she screeched inside herself.
If he can—I will.
She said, Tom!
I want a purple egg.
The little springs trickled on late in the summer.
The anvil rang in the forge again.
He painted the old house white and whitewashed the sheds.
That was not all—he labored with humor and good spirits.
And the pains were a secret in herself.
Just a little crick.
I’m all right now.
And in a moment they were laughing.
They laughed a great deal, as though to reassure themselves.
Since both were shy they never talked about themselves.
Neither knew about the other at all.
He looked quickly at her and away.
He said, Who’d have me?
Is that a joke or do you really mean it?
Who’d have me?
he said again.
Who’d want a thing like me?
It sounds to me as though you really mean it.
Then she violated their unstated code.
Have you been in love with someone?
No, he said shortly.
But on the porch he said suddenly, You’re lonely here.
You don’t want to stay.
He waited for a moment.
Isn’t that true?
She asked, Do you ever go to women?
Yes, he said.
Is it any good to you?
What are you going to do?
I don’t know.
In silence they went back to the house.
Tom lighted the lamp in the old living room.
Tom sat down by the round center table.
She wished her father were here.
Her father had felt greatness in Tom.
I never have.
Neither have I, said Tom.
Well, isn’t that silly?
Lots of people haven’t, he said.
But it’s not a law.
I would dearly love to see the Colosseum.
He watched her suspiciously, expecting some kind of joke.
How could we?
That takes a lot of money.
I don’t think it does, she said.
We wouldn’t have to stay in fancy places.
We could take the cheapest boats and the lowest class.
That’s how our father came here from Ireland.
And we could go to Ireland.
I can get some sewing to do in King City.
Will would help us.
There’s no law forbids it.
Tom got up and went outside.
Then he turned and went back into the house.
Dessie had not moved.
Do you want to go, Dessie?
More than anything in the world.
Then we will go!
Do you want to go?
Athens, she said.
Yes, Bethlehem, said he suddenly, Go to bed.
We’ve got a year of work—a year.
Get some rest.
What will you feed them?
Acorns, said Tom.
I’ll make a machine to gather acorns.
Dessie looked over his shoulder.
Is it the acorn machine?
It should be easy, he said.
But how to get out the sticks and rocks?
What do you mean?
Children, she said.
Those restless little hands.
They wouldn’t do it, not even for pay.
They would for prizes.
They’d sweep the valley clean.
Will you let me try?
He scratched his head.
But how would you collect the acorns?
The children will bring them in, said Dessie.
Just let me take care of it.
I hope you have plenty of storage space.
It would be exploiting the young, wouldn’t it?
Certainly it would, Dessie agreed.
And I won’t let everyone in.
Sure I would, he said.
But couldn’t we pay them too?
Not with money, Dessie said.
Tom leaned back from his board and laughed.
Nor will I, he said.
But you made money in Salinas, he said.
But oh, I was rich in promises.
We could go to Paris tomorrow.
He pushed his chair back from the drawing board.
Want to come with me?
No, I’ll stay and make my plans.
Tomorrow I start The Great Acorn Contest.
The whole thing was shaky, particularly in these times.
To indicate enthusiasm was to be idiotic.
And Will really did mean to think it over.
Parts of the plan fascinated him.
Tom had stumbled on a very interesting thing.
Will would not rob his brother.
Everybody in the whole valley would pick acorns.
He didn’t know the price of a steamship ticket.
They might spend the evening figuring.
But Dessie didn’t run out.
Maybe taking a nap, he thought.
Taking a nap?
Dessie, he cried, what’s the matter?
She rallied herself against pain.
Just a stomach ache, she said.
A pretty severe one.
Oh, said Tom.
You scared me.
I can fix up a stomach ache.
He handed it to her.
What is it, Tom?
Good old-fashioned salts.
She drank it obediently and made a face.
I remember that taste, she said.
Mother’s remedy in green apple season.
Now you lie still, Tom said.
I’ll rustle up some dinner.
She could hear him knocking about in the kitchen.
The pain roared through her body.
And on top of the pain there was fear.
She could feel the medicine burn down to her stomach.
The perspiration ran from her forehead and blinded her.
Later Tom brought her some scrambled eggs.
She shook her head slowly.
I can’t, she said, smiling.
I think I’ll just go to bed.
The salts should work pretty soon, Tom assured her.
Then you’ll be all right.
He helped her to bed.
What do you suppose you ate to cause it?
She called, Tom!
He opened the door.
He had the World Almanac in his hand.
Tom, she said, I’m sorry.
But I’m awfully sick, Tom.
I’m terribly sick.
Are the gripes bad?
Can you go to the toilet now?
No, not now.
I’ll bring a lamp and sit with you, he said.
Maybe you can get some sleep.
It’ll be gone in the morning.
The salts will do the job.
A thin scream awakened him.
He stepped beside the struggling bedclothes.
I don’t care.
Get him, goddam it.
Red Duncan sleepily had the gun on him.
Tilson said, Yes!
Yes—yes, I hear.
You’re Tom Hamilton.
What’s the matter with her?
Is her stomach hard?
What did you do?
You goddam fool!
Then the doctor controlled his anger.
Tom, he said, Tom, boy.
Pull yourself together.
I don’t suppose you have any ice.
Well, keep changing the cloths.
I’ll be out as fast as I can.
Do you hear me?
Tom, do you hear me?
He hung the receiver up and dressed.
His wife in boudoir cap and nightgown looked in.
Tilson said, I’m walking over to the garage.
Call Will Hamilton.
If he argues tell him his sister is—dying.
Tom had done everything slowly, perfectly.
The lamp in the living room was fair and lonely.
Tom sat down in the evening and looked around.
His eyes avoided the horsehair sofa.
And his name was called, shrilly in his ears.
Samuel spoke softly but his voice filled the room.
Be good, be pure, be great, be Tom Hamilton.
Tom ignored his father.
Then he started with Vanity again.
The Gray One shouldered up in front.
It was too late to stall with baby sins.
This Gray One was Murder.
Just wait till morning.
You’ll feel fine then.
But it wasn’t for lack of trying.
He shuffled possibilities like cards.
Egypt—pyramids in Egypt and the Sphinx.
Now wait—they do all your sins lots better there.
Well, stand aside and maybe we’ll come back to you.
Dear God, no!
It would be lonely there for a stranger.
Thank you, Tom said to the sofa.
His mind dozed.
Murder slapped him aware again.
That takes some doing, with maybe pain and maybe hell.
There must be a way to avoid Liza’s disapproval.
She could make one suffer if she disapproved.
Tom had to tell Samuel.
He said, My father, I’m sorry.
I can’t help it.
You overestimated me.
You were wrong.
Maybe you could figure a way out, but I can’t.
I cannot live.
I’ve killed Dessie and I want to sleep.
Why are you so impatient, dear?
I can’t wait, that’s why, Tom said.
I can’t wait any more.
Why, sure you can, my son, my darling.
You’re grown great as I knew you would.
He wrote, Dear Mother, I hope you keep yourself well.
I’ve had a stroke of good luck.
I must say he’s a pretty cute article.
Come back with your shield or on it.
I’ll see you Thanksgiving.
Your son Tom.
He added, P.
I notice that Polly has not reformed one bit.
That parrot makes me blush.
For Mother’s sake—please.
Your brother Tom.
He was a gallant gentlemen.
A child may ask, What is the world’s story about?
There is no other story.
Have I done well—or ill?
Who, he asked, is the luckiest person in the world?
Solon told him of three lucky people in old times.
Solon did not hesitate in his answer.
How can I tell?
You aren’t dead yet.
is another way of putting Croesus’s question.
I remember clearly the deaths of three men.
I was on a ship when he died.
A bribed man can only hate his briber.
This man was hated by the few.
How can we go on without him?
We have only one story.
Perhaps Adam caught his intention from Lee’s coldness and formality.
Adam said, All right.
I’ve been expecting it.
I have a speech all ready.
Do you want to hear it?
Do you want to say it?
No, said Lee.
And it’s a pretty good speech too.
When do you want to go?
As soon as possible.
Better not, said Adam.
You know how slow I am.
It might be some time.
I might never get around to it.
I’ll go tomorrow then.
It will tear the boys to pieces, Adam said.
I don’t know what they’ll do.
It’s my observation that children always surprise us, said Lee.
And so it was.
There’s a basketball game tonight, costs ten cents.
Can we go?
But did you hear what I said?
Sure, Aron said.
You said Lee’s going away.
But he’s not coming back.
Cal asked, Where’s he going?
To San Francisco to live.
They cost a nickel.
And you can take all the mustard you want.
Lee stood in the kitchen door, smiling at Adam.
They shouted, Good-by!
and tumbled out of the house.
I like it better that way, Lee said.
If they pretended sorrow they’d be liars.
It doesn’t mean anything to them.
Maybe they’ll think of me sometimes—privately.
I don’t want them to be sad.
My farewell gift may be ptomaine, for all I know.
Is that all your stuff, Lee?
Everything but my books.
They’re in boxes in the cellar.
Are you really going to get your bookstore?
That is my intention.
You’ll let us hear from you?
I don’t know.
I’ll have to think about it.
They say a clean cut heals soonest.
Adam stood up from the table.
I’ll walk to the depot with you.
Lee said sharply.
I don’t want that.
Walking home, the twins discussed Lee for the first time.
I wonder why he went away?
He’s talked about going before.
What do you suppose he’ll do without us?
I don’t know.
I bet he comes back, Aron said.
How do you mean?
Father said he was going to start a bookstore.
A Chinese bookstore.
He’ll come back, said Aron.
He’ll get lonesome for us.
Bet you ten cents he don’t.
That’s a bet, said Aron.
Lee put down his basket.
If you soak it overnight it will come right out.
I’ve burned everything I’ve cooked.
There’s a saucepan of beets out in the yard.
Smelled so bad I couldn’t have them in the house.
Burned beets are awful—Lee!
he cried, and then.
Is anything the matter?
I might as well build up the fire.
Stove won’t burn, said Adam.
Lee lifted a lid.
Have you ever taken the ashes out?
Oh, go in the other room, said Lee.
I’ll make some coffee.
Made it in a skillet, he said.
He brought out the stone bottle.
Chinese absinthe, he said.
Ng-ka-py maybe last ten more years.
I forgot to ask whether you had replaced me.
You’re beating around the bush, said Adam.
I know it.
You lost your money in a fan-tan game.
I wish that was it.
No, I have my money.
He poured the black liquor into his coffee.
I never drank it this way, he said.
Say, it’s good.
Tastes like rotten apples, said Adam.
Yes, but remember Sam Hamilton said like good rotten apples.
Nothing happened to me, said Lee.
I got lonesome.
Isn’t that enough?
How about your bookstore?
I don’t want a bookstore.
Then there’s your last dream gone.
Lee seemed on the verge of hysteria.
Missy Tlask, Chinee boy sink gung get dlunk.
Adam was alarmed.
What’s the matter with you anyway?
I’ve never been so goddam lonesome in my life.
The West End had grades from third to eighth.
It seemed wasteful.
Cal worked it out quickly and explained it to Aron.
Know what we’re going to do?
That’s right, said Aron.
So she’ll call on us and we’ll know.
That’ll throw her.
Pretty soon she’ll let us alone.
Cal’s method worked.
Both boys learned easily enough.
He traded them for tops just as marble season ended.
Cal was growing up dark-skinned, dark-haired.
He was quick and sure and secret.
If he concealed his ingenuity, he concealed his hurts too.
He was regarded as thick-skinned and insensitive—even cruel.
Aron drew love from every side.
He seemed shy and delicate.
Aron did not attempt to hide his disposition.
It was concealed by being the opposite of his appearance.
He was unchanging once a course was set.
He had few facets and very little versatility.
Cal had learned when to sidestep, when to run away.
His emotions were few and heavy.
He went over to the girlside to talk to Abra.
A mob of squealing girls could not drive him out.
He waited outside the schoolyard gate for her after school.
She came out surrounded by girls.
The cloud of girls hung on and hung on.
Aron sat down on the edge of the sidewalk.
She walked across the walk and stood over him.
What do you want?
Aron’s wide eyes looked up at her.
You aren’t engaged to anybody?
Silly, she said.
He struggled up to his feet.
Who wants to get married?
Aron didn’t answer.
Perhaps he didn’t hear.
He walked along beside her.
There was wisdom and sweetness in her expression.
She seemed deep in thought.
The black ’dobe clods crushed under their feet.
The afternoon sunlight came yellow through the aging leaves.
Aron sat down beside her.
Not so long, Abra said.
I wish it was now.
It won’t be so long, said Abra.
Aron asked, Do you think your father will let you?
Maybe I won’t ask him.
But your mother?
Let’s not disturb them, she said.
They’d think it was funny or bad.
Can’t you keep a secret?
I can keep secrets better than anybody.
And I’ve got some too.
Abra, do you know how you get babies?
Yes, she said.
Who told you?
Lee told me.
He explained the whole thing.
Not so long, she said.
We’ll have a house together some time, Aron said, bemused.
But that will be a long time.
Don’t you worry about long times, she said.
This is a kind of a house.
We can play like we live here while we’re waiting.
He tried it over under his breath and then aloud.
Wife, he said.
It’ll be like practicing, said Abra.
Maybe you wouldn’t like it.
What is it?
Maybe we could pretend like you’re my mother.
That’s easy, she said.
Would you mind?
No, I’d like it.
Do you want to start now?
Sure, Aron said.
How do you want to go about it?
Oh, I can tell you that, said Abra.
Come, my little son.
Mother will hold you.
My good little baby, Abra said.
Here, let Mother brush your hair back.
I don’t know why I cried.
Abra asked, Do you remember your mother?
Don’t you know what she looked like?
Maybe you saw a picture.
No, I tell you.
We don’t have any pictures.
When did she die?
Right after Cal and I were born.
What was her name?
Lee says it was Cathy.
Say, what you asking so much for?
Abra went on calmly, How was she complected?
Light or dark hair?
I don’t know.
Didn’t your father tell you?
We never asked him.
Abra inspected the setting sun.
Aron asked uneasily, You mad with me—and he added tentatively—wife?
No, I’m not mad.
I’m just wondering.
Abra’s firm face was tight against a seething inner argument.
She asked, What’s it like not to have any mother?
I don’t know.
It’s like anything else.
I guess you wouldn’t even know the difference.
I would too.
I wish you would talk out.
You’re like riddles in the Bulletin.
That’s crazy, said Aron.
 ’Course I do.
You aren’t trying to hurt my feelings, are you?
Cal tries that sometimes and then he laughs.
Abra looked away from the setting sun.
You said a little while ago you could keep secrets.
Well, do you have a double-poison-and-cut-my-throat secret?
Sure I have.
Abra said softly, Tell me what it is, Aron.
She put a caress in his name.
Tell you what?
Tell me the deepest down hell-and-goddam secret you know.
Aron reared back from her in alarm.
Why, I will not, he said.
What right you got to ask me?
I wouldn’t tell anybody.
Come on, my baby—tell Mother, she crooned.
I think I’m going home now.
Abra put her hand on his wrist and hung on.
Her voice lost its coquetry.
I wanted to see.
I guess you can keep secrets all right.
Why did you go for to do it?
I’m mad now.
I feel sick.
he jeered at her.
Who can’t keep a secret now?
I was trying to decide, she said.
It might make you glad.
Who told you not to tell?
Nobody, she said.
I only told myself.
Well, I guess that’s a little different.
What’s your old secret?
They said your mother wasn’t dead.
They said she went away.
Aron said hoarsely, She’s dead.
Wouldn’t it be nice if she wasn’t?
My father says she’s dead.
He’s not a liar.
Maybe he thinks she’s dead.
He said, I think he’d know.
But there was uncertainty in his tone.
’Spose she lost her memory or something.
I’ve read about that.
Aron said, I’ll ask my father.
She said, Now spit in your palm—like this—that’s right.
Now you give me your hand—see?
the spit all together.
Now rub it dry on your hair.
The evening star shimmered over Mount Toro.
Abra said, They’ll skin me alive.
I’ll get whipped.
Aron looked at her in disbelief.
They don’t whip you?
That’s what you think!
Aron said passionately, You just let them try.
His wide-set blue eyes were slitted and glinting.
Nobody’s going to whip my wife, he said.
She kissed him on his open mouth.
It was hard.
The door was shut against everything except physical pain.
Aron held it back until last.
Perhaps the getting it was what had made him cry.
Next he thought of her trick—her testing of him.
slipped into his mind.
And how did it feel?
It didn’t feel like anything.
That’s what it was like.
It was quite dark under the willow tree now.
His mother was alive.
But this was not so.
Aron was puzzled.
He inspected the cloud of sadness.
If his mother was alive, his father was a liar.
If one was alive, the other was dead.
Aron said aloud under the tree, My mother is dead.
She’s buried some place in the East.
Lee had built very well.
I don’t believe it ever works kindly.
That’s a running sore.
He was lost.
He had no one to ask.
His solution lay suddenly before him.
Abra had not lied.
He was late for supper.
I was with Abra, he explained.
What is it, Aron?
Good night, Father, Aron said.
February of 1915 was a year heavy with water.
The Trasks were well established in Salinas.
The large bedroom nearest the street door fell to him.
Lee dipped into his savings.
It would be a shame not to enjoy it.
I’m not complaining, Adam protested.
Only I’d like to buy something too.
What shall I buy?
I think I’ll do that, said Adam.
The growing century was shucking Adam out of his shell.
He subscribed to the Atlantic Monthly and the National Geographic.
He joined the Masons and seriously considered the Elks.
The new icebox fascinated him.
The truth was that Adam needed work.
I think I’ll go into business, he said to Lee.
You don’t need to.
You have enough to live on.
But I’d like to be doing something.
That’s different, said Lee.
Know what you want to do?
I don’t think you’d be very good at business.
Just a thought, said Lee.
Say, Lee, I want you to read an article.
It says they’ve dug up a mastodon in Siberia.
Been in the ice thousands of years.
And the meat’s still good.
Lee smiled at him.
You’ve got a bug in your bonnet somewhere, he said.
Is that the business?
Some of the cups smell bad.
It’s an idea, Adam said.
I can’t seem to stay away from it.
The frozen mastodon stayed in his mind.
The horse-drawn ice wagon went its route every day.
Sam would have covered the field very quickly, he thought.
He followed him and leaned against the bar beside him.
I’d like to, Will said.
If I get finished in time I’ll walk by.
Is there something important?
Well, I don’t know.
Well, the boys, particularly Cal, they like the place.
I think I’ll hang on to it.
I think I can turn it over for you.
No, it’s rented, paying its own taxes.
I’ll hold on to it.
Will Hamilton was a very substantial businessman.
His business deal had been non-existent.
He had supper alone in the Abbot House.
The boys had gone to bed.
Adam had been reading the Scientific American.
He let Will in and placed a chair for him.
He waited for Adam to open the game.
Nice weather for a change.
And how’s your mother?
Seems younger every day.
The boys must be growing up.
Oh, they are.
Cal’s going to be in his school play.
He’s quite an actor.
Aron’s a real good student.
Cal wants to go to farming.
Nothing wrong with that if you go about it right.
Country could use some forward-looking farmers.
Will waited uneasily.
Could Adam be getting ready to borrow money?
And still Adam did not come up with his proposition.
Will grew restless.
I can’t stay very long, he said.
Told a fellow I’d meet him later tonight.
Have another cup of coffee, Adam suggested.
Keeps me awake.
Did you have something you wanted to see me about?
Will relaxed a little in his chair.
He was a great old talker.
Lee looked up from his darning egg.
I’d swear to God you used to talk pidgin.
I used to, said Lee.
It was vanity, I guess.
Meat was still fresh?
Sweet as a pork chop, said Lee.
That’s very interesting, said Will.
I guess I’m pretty roundabout.
I want to get something to take up my time.
Why don’t you farm your place?
That doesn’t interest me.
I’m looking for work.
I don’t need a job.
Will came out of his cautiousness.
Well, what can I do for you?
You’re a businessman.
Of course, said Will.
Anything I can do.
I’ve been looking into refrigeration, said Adam.
Never had anything give me so much trouble.
It’s a kind of a big idea.
Maybe it’s full of holes.
Go ahead—shoot, he said.
Like a cigar?
The whole country’s changing, Adam said.
People aren’t going to live the way they used to.
New York City.
I read that.
Right here isn’t right there, said Will.
What’s your idea?
I put different kinds of vegetables in there.
And I got to arranging them different ways.
Go on, said Will cautiously.
Well, you know the railroads built those fruit cars.
I went down and had a look at them.
They’re pretty good.
Will asked, Where do you come in?
That would cost a lot of money.
I have quite a lot of money, said Adam.
Will Hamilton putted his lip angrily.
I don’t know why I got into this, he said.
I know better.
How do you mean?
Look here, said Will.
He wants me to agree with him.
Adam remonstrated, What are you getting upset about?
We had ideas for breakfast.
We had ideas instead of breakfast.
Well, I don’t care much.
You stop right there, Adam.
I’ve got my neck out.
But I’m telling you—let your damned idea die.
Kick dust over it.
What’s wrong with it?
Everything’s wrong with it.
They wouldn’t buy them.
The market is controlled.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
You make Sam Hamilton sound like a criminal, he said.
He shook his head slowly from side to side.
I didn’t mean to run down my people, he said.
I think they were good people.
But my advice to you stands.
Let refrigeration alone.
Adam turned slowly to Lee.
I don’t think so, said Lee.
I thought I heard mice in the kitchen.
You’ve got half a quart of whisky.
Why don’t we have that?
A drink would do me good.
I’m getting too fat, he said.
But he had two drinks and relaxed.
Sitting comfortably, he instructed Adam.
Some things don’t ever change their value, he said.
And when there’s war there’s going to be hungry people.
I don’t trust this Wilson—he’s all theory and big words.
They keep, and people can stay alive on them.
Beans are up to three cents now.
If you want to turn a profit, you plant beans.
He went away feeling good.
He’s getting too fat, Lee said.
Adam was thinking.
I only said I wanted something to do, he observed.
How about the ice-plant?
I think I’ll buy it.
You might plant some beans too, said Lee.
The Chamber of Commerce attended the departure.
But no one wanted to invest in the project.
Adam untapped energy he did not suspect he had.
There was no equipment for such work.
Everyone gave advice but no one helped.
Adam did not know.
Only Lee knew.
The idea looked good.
The boys heard the reaction in Salinas.
Adam was a fool.
These know-it-all dreamers always got into trouble.
It took experience to be a businessman.
People who inherited their money always got into trouble.
A fool and his money were soon parted.
Maybe that would teach him a lesson.
And he had doubled the output of the ice company.
And as for Tom Hamilton—he had been just crazy.
How do you feel?
What makes you think that?
And you’ve got that sleepwalker light in your eyes.
Does this hurt your feelings?
No, said Adam.
Not quite, said Lee.
You have about nine thousand dollars left and the ranch.
There’s a two-thousand-dollar bill for garbage disposal, said Adam.
That’s before the nine thousand.
I owe quite a bit for the new ice machinery.
I have nine thousand?
And the ranch, said Lee.
Maybe you can sell the ice plant.
Adam’s face tightened up and lost the dazed smile.
I still believe it will work, he said.
It was a whole lot of accidents.
I’m going to keep the ice plant.
Cold does preserve things.
Besides, the plant makes some money.
Maybe I can figure something out.
Try not to figure something that costs money, said Lee.
I would hate to leave my gas stove.
The twins felt Adam’s failure very deeply.
Aron discussed his problem with Abra.
It’s going to make a big difference, he told her.
Abra had grown to be a beautiful girl.
She had gone beyond prettiness.
She was strong and sure and feminine.
Well, one thing, I think we’re poor.
You would have worked anyway.
You know I want to go to college.
You still can.
I’ll help you.
Did your father lose all his money?
I don’t know.
That’s what they say.
Who is they’?
You’re pretty sure of yourself.
Yes, she said, I’m pretty sure of myself.
Will you kiss me?
Right in the street?
I want them to, said Abra.
Aron said, No.
I don’t like to make things public like that.
She stepped around in front of him and stopped him.
You look here, mister.
You kiss me now.
She said slowly, So everybody will know that I’m Mrs.
Maybe I ought to call it off myself, he said.
What do you mean?
Well, I’m not good enough for you now.
I’m just another poor kid.
You think I haven’t seen the difference in your father?
You’re just crazy, Abra said.
The rage was celery tonic that year.
The year before it had been root-beer ice-cream sodas.
But I’m engaged to Aron.
he snorted at her.
Since when do children get engaged?
You’d better look around a little.
There are other fish in the sea.
She leaned across the table.
We could run your father’s ranch.
My father says it’s beautiful land.
No, Aron said quickly.
a farmer’s wife.
I’m not going to give up college, he said.
I’ll help you, Abra said again.
Where would you get the money?
Steal it, she said.
I want to get out of this town, he said.
Everybody’s sneering at me.
I can’t stand it here.
They’ll forget it pretty soon.
No, they won’t either.
Do you want to go away from me, Aron?
Abra reproved him.
Don’t you blame your father.
If it had worked everybody’d been bowing to him.
Well, it didn’t work.
He sure fixed me.
I can’t hold up my head.
I hate him.
Abra said sternly, Aron!
You stop talking like that!
How do I know he didn’t lie about my mother?
Abra’s face reddened with anger.
You ought to be spanked, she said.
Why don’t you ask about your mother?
Just come right out and ask him.
I can’t, I promised you.
You only promised not to say what I told you.
All right, she cried, you’re a spoiled baby!
I let you out of your promise.
Go ahead and ask him.
I don’t know if I will or not.
Sometimes I want to kill you, she said.
But Aron—I do love you so.
I do love you so.
Aron blushed and tears of anger started in his eyes.
She walked calmly over to Mr.
Bell and paid for the celery tonics.
You let him alone, she said coldly.
She called on the telephone.
Lee said that Aron had not come home.
Abra had lost her gift for being alone.
Cal had to learn loneliness.
His studies he found easy and not greatly interesting.
Cal drifted through.
His growing restlessness drove him out at night.
And since he was pretending, his performance was not convincing.
Perhaps in his father’s very unawareness Cal had felt safety.
When he was quite small Cal had discovered a secret.
It was a magic to be depended upon.
It was the ceremonial symbol of a dogged adoration.
Things do not change with a change of scene.
He lived alone and walked alone.
The night constables sometimes saw him walking alone.
I’m not bothering anybody, said Cal defensively.
I know you’re not.
But you ought to be home in bed.
He wanted to dig out the truth.
He knew that his mother was not dead.
Cal sat quietly beside him, listening.
Funny, he said, thought I only had one.
Well, it’s a good mistake.
Tell you what, George, he said.
Now don’t say you can’t afford it.
The whole shebang’s on me.
Did I tell you I sold forty acres?
Wasn’t no good neither.
And he said, Harry, tell you what let’s do.
Let’s keep away from them two-bit whores.
We’ll go to Kate’s place.
Costs high, ten bucks, but what the hell!
They got a circus down there.
Ever seen a circus, Harry?
Well, it’s a lulu.
Kate sure knows her stuff.
You remember who Kate is, don’t you, George?
She’s Adam Trask’s wife, mother of them damn twins.
Plugged him in the shoulder and just runoff.
Ain’t nothing new for them to experiment with.
Help me up a little, will you, Harry?
What was I saying?
Circus, said Cal softly.
Well, this circus of Kate’s will pop your eyes out.
Know what they do?
Rabbit told what they did.
And what they did wasn’t what made Cal sick.
That just seemed to him silly.
It was the men who watched.
Cal spoke softly and rapidly.
I know where my mother is and what she’s doing.
I saw her.
Lee’s mind said a convulsive prayer for guidance.
What do you want to know?
he asked softly.
I haven’t thought yet.
I’m trying to think.
Would you tell me the truth?
Does my father know?
Why did he say she was dead?
To save you from pain.
What did my father do to make her leave?
He loved her with his whole mind and body.
He gave her everything he could imagine.
Did she shoot him?
Because he didn’t want her to go away.
Did he ever hurt her?
Not that I know of.
It wasn’t in him to hurt her.
Lee, why did she do it?
I don’t know.
Don’t know or won’t say?
He was relieved when Cal spoke again.
The boy’s tone was different.
There was a pleading in it.
Lee, you knew her.
What was she like?
Lee sighed and his hands relaxed.
I can only say what I think.
I may be wrong.
Well, what did you think?
She is a mystery.
There is something she lacks.
Kindness maybe, or conscience.
And I can’t feel her.
It’s a mystery.
And her hatred wasn’t healthy.
It wasn’t angry.
It was heartless.
I need to know.
Didn’t you feel better before you knew?
But I can’t stop now.
You’re right, said Lee.
Cal said, Tell me about my father then.
That I can do, said Lee.
I wonder if anyone can hear us talking?
Tell me about him, said Cal.
They trip him up and hinder him.
What did he do when she left?
He died, said Lee.
He walked around but he was dead.
And only recently has he come half to life again.
Lee saw a strange new expression on Cal’s face.
What is it, Cal?
I love him, Cal said.
I love him too, said Lee.
Maybe the best man I have ever known.
Cal stood up suddenly.
Good night, Lee, he said.
Now you wait just a moment.
Have you told anyone?
Not Aron—no, of course you wouldn’t.
Suppose he finds out?
Then you’d have to stand by to help him.
Don’t go yet.
You may dislike me for knowing you know the truth.
Tell me this—do you hate your mother?
Yes, said Cal.
I wondered, said Lee.
I don’t think your father ever hated her.
He had only sorrow.
Cal drifted toward the door, slowly, softly.
He shoved his fists deep in his pockets.
It’s like you said about knowing people.
I hate her because I know why she went away.
I know—because I’ve got her in me.
His head was down and his voice was heartbroken.
Lee jumped up.
You stop that!
he said sharply.
You hear me?
Don’t let me catch you doing that.
Of course you may have that in you.
But you’ve got the other too.
Look at me!
You’ve got the other too.
Listen to me!
You wouldn’t even be wondering if you didn’t have it.
Don’t you dare take the lazy way.
It’s too easy to excuse yourself because of your ancestry.
Don’t let me catch you doing it!
Now—look close at me so you will remember.
Do you believe that, Lee?
After Cal had gone Lee went back to his chair.
And his reaction was twofold.
His discovery sharpened all of his emotions.
The circus at Kate’s remained with him.
In Cal’s own sensitized mind that suffering was unbearable.
Adam’s fingers went up as though to conceal the scar.
He said, It’s an old wound, Cal.
I was in the Indian campaigns.
I’ll tell you about it some time.
To be driven to a lie seemed shameful to him.
But, of course, he did not.
I’d like to hear about it, he said.
His body did not scream at him so shrilly.
His passions took a religious direction.
He decided on the ministry for his future.
Abra followed him.
He denounced Cal’s godlessness, demanded his reformation.
Aron’s religion inevitably took a sexual turn.
Celibacy was the only state she had known.
He didn’t think Aron could handle it at all.
At intervals Salinas suffered from a mild eructation of morality.
The process never varied much.
One burst was like another.
Gambling was invariably the sin to be eradicated.
There were certain advantages in attacking gambling.
One could discuss it, which was not true of prostitution.
From church and club the town’s two newspapers caught fire.
Editorials demanded a clean-up.
What followed was as carefully produced as a ballet.
Then came the raid, deliberate and sure.
The chief telephoned Adam, got him up from his breakfast.
Want me to wait for you?
he asked Cal.
No, said Cal.
He kept his eyes down and ate his eggs.
Adam had not spoken except to say, Come along!
at the City Hall after he had thanked the Chief.
He could make nothing of Adam’s expression.
Adam stared down into his coffee cup.
Lee looked in.
Adam shook his head slowly.
Lee withdrew and this time closed the kitchen door.
In the clock-ticking silence Cal began to be afraid.
As the fear began to chill, resentment took its place.
Suddenly Cal jumped up.
He hadn’t known he was going to move.
He cried, Do what you’re going to do to me!
Get it over!
And his shout was sucked into the silence.
Adam slowly raised his head.
Adam said slowly, I’ve failed you, haven’t I?
It was worse than an attack.
Cal faltered, What do you mean?
You were picked up in a gambling house.
Cal sat limply down and looked at his plate.
Do you gamble, son?
I was just watching.
Had you been there before?
Why do you go?
I don’t know.
I get restless at night—like an alley cat, I guess.
Adam considered his words, inspected each one.
Does your brother walk around too?
Oh, no, sir.
He wouldn’t think of it.
He’s—he’s not restless.
You see, I don’t know, said Adam.
I don’t know anything about you.
He wanted some wild demonstration of sympathy and love.
I’d tell you if you asked, he said softly.
I didn’t ask.
I didn’t ask!
I’m as bad a father as my father was.
Cal had never heard this tone in Adam’s voice.
I was a bad casting but I couldn’t be remelted.
Nobody can be remelted.
And so I remained a bad casting.
Cal said, Sir, don’t be sorry.
You’ve had too much of that.
Maybe—but maybe the wrong kind.
I don’t know my sons.
I wonder whether I could learn.
I’ll tell you anything you want to know.
Just ask me.
Where would I start?
Right at the beginning?
Are you sad or mad because I was in jail?
To Cal’s surprise Adam laughed.
You were just there, weren’t you?
You didn’t do anything wrong.
Maybe being there was wrong.
Cal wanted a blame for himself.
One time I was just there, said Adam.
Cal tried to absorb this heresy.
I don’t believe it, he said.
Adam said, Do you remember Samuel Hamilton?
That old man?
He was a tough old man.
And now I know what he meant.
I’m the same as my father was.
That’s what Samuel meant.
Cal said, We don’t think you’re a bad father.
Poor things, said Adam.
How would you know?
You’ve never had any other kind.
I’m glad I was in jail, said Cal.
So am I.
So am I.
We’ve both been in jail—we can talk together.
A gaiety grew in him.
Well, tell me.
You see, there’s a responsibility in being a person.
What are you like?
Cal asked shyly.
No joke—oh, surely, no joke.
Tell me about yourself—that is, if you want to.
Cal began, Well—I’m— He stopped.
It’s not so easy when you try, he said.
I guess it would be—maybe impossible.
Tell me about your brother.
What do you want to know about him?
What you think of him, I guess.
That’s all you could tell me.
Cal said, He’s good.
He doesn’t do bad things.
He doesn’t think bad things.
Now you’re telling about yourself.
You’re saying you do and think bad things.
Cal’s cheeks reddened.
Well, I do.
Very bad things?
Do you want me to tell?
But you shouldn’t be ashamed.
It’s awful to be ashamed.
Is Aron ever ashamed?
He doesn’t do anything to be ashamed of.
Adam leaned forward.
Are you sure?
Tell me, Cal—do you protect him?
How do you mean, sir?
I—I think so.
It’s not that, sir.
He’s really good.
He never does anyone harm.
He never says bad things about anyone.
He’s not mean and he never complains and he’s brave.
He doesn’t like to fight but he will.
You love your brother, don’t you?
And I do bad things to him.
I cheat him and I fool him.
Sometimes I hurt him for no reason at all.
And then you’re miserable?
Is Aron ever miserable?
I don’t know.
He was sick.
He had a fever.
Don’t you remember?
Lee sent for the doctor.
Why was Abra mad?
Cal said, I don’t know if I ought to tell.
I don’t want you to then.
It’s nothing bad.
I guess it’s all right.
You see, sir, Aron wants to be a minister.
Like a monk, you mean?
And Abra didn’t like that?
She got spitting mad.
She can get mad sometimes.
She said she’d wasted half her life on Aron.
How old is Abra?
But she’s—well, more than that some ways.
I should say she is.
What did Aron do?
He just got quiet but he felt awful bad.
Abra is Aron’s girl, said Cal.
Adam looked deeply into Cal’s eyes.
Then he called, Lee!
There was no answer.
he called again.
He said, I didn’t hear him go out.
I want some fresh coffee.
Cal jumped up.
I’ll make it.
Say, said Adam, you should be in school.
I don’t want to go.
You ought to go.
I’m happy, Cal said.
I want to be with you.
Adam looked down at his hands.
His nerves and muscles throbbed with an excited hunger.
His fingers yearned to grasp, his legs to run.
His eyes avidly brought the room into focus.
He said to himself, I wouldn’t have done this yesterday.
It boiled over, said Cal.
It has to boil over to taste good, Adam said.
I wonder where Lee went.
Maybe in his room.
Shall I look?
He’d have answered.
You’re planning early.
How about Aron?
He wants to go to college.
Don’t tell him I told you.
Let him tell you, and you be surprised.
Why, that’s fine, said Adam.
But don’t you want to go to college too?
Adam sipped his coffee.
That’s a generous thing, he said.
I have hated him, Cal said vehemently.
And I’ve hurt him too.
But, sir, can I tell you something?
I don’t hate him now.
I won’t ever hate him again.
Adam looked straight ahead.
He rubbed his forehead with the palm of his hand.
Finally he said quietly, You know about your mother.
It was not a question.
All about her?
Adam leaned back in his chair.
Does Aron know?
He doesn’t know.
Why do you say it that way?
I wouldn’t dare to tell him.
Cal said brokenly, I don’t think he could stand it.
He hasn’t enough badness in him to stand it.
Adam’s face looked weary.
He moved his head from side to side.
Cal, listen to me.
Cal said, He doesn’t go near places like that.
He’s not like me.
Suppose someone told him?
I don’t think he would believe it, sir.
You’ve been there?
I had to know.
That might be.
But he has two more years here.
But you’re smarter?
A different kind of smart, said Cal.
he said harshly.
I trust you, son, said Adam.
Adam’s recognition brought a ferment of happiness to Cal.
He walked on the balls of his feet.
Who wants a girl?
Everybody, said Lee.
Adam said, He knows about her.
Lee stayed out of trouble.
Well, you remember I thought you should have told them.
I didn’t tell him.
What do you think of that!
How about Aron?
I’m afraid of that, said Adam.
I don’t think I want him to know.
It might be too late.
I might have a talk with Aron.
Kind of feel around.
Something’s happened to you too.
I guess it has, said Adam.
He set himself to learn all he could about her.
A known enemy is less dangerous, less able to surprise.
He saw the girls come out, dressed somberly, even severely.
He found that Kate emerged every Monday at one-thirty.
Aron was not much interested anyway.
In his self-immersion Aron soon forgot the whole thing.
She spent fifteen or twenty minutes there.
She never varied the route.
There was nothing strange about her clothing.
The gloves made her hands seem puffed and pudgy.
For a number of weeks Cal followed Kate.
He tried not to attract her attention.
Cal waited a moment, then strolled past the rickety gate.
Kate was standing behind a tall ragged privet.
She said to him coldly, What do you want?
Cal froze in his steps.
He was suspended in time, barely breathing.
He observed and catalogued details outside his main object.
Kate said, This isn’t the first time you’ve followed me.
What do you want?
He dipped his head.
Nothing, he said.
Who told you to do it?
You won’t tell me, will you?
Cal heard his own next speech with amazement.
It was out before he could stop it.
What is this?
Who are you?
I’m Cal Trask, he said.
His was the upper seat now.
She looked at him closely, observed every feature.
A dim remembered picture of Charles leaped into her mind.
Suddenly she said, Come with me!
Kate preceded him down a hall and into her room.
As she went past the kitchen entrance she called, Tea.
In her room she seemed to have forgotten him!
Come in here!
Bring that chair with you.
He followed her into a box of a room.
It had no windows, no decorations of any kind.
Its walls were painted a dark gray.
A solid gray carpet covered the floor.
Close the door!
The fingers of both hands were bandaged.
Kate said angrily, Don’t stare.
Oh—so you want to see, do you?
There—look at it, she said.
God, those gloves hurt!
Cal crouched on the edge of his chair.
You’ll probably get it, Kate said.
The room was very silent.
There was a soft knock on the door.
Kate called, Is that you, Joe?
Set the tray down out there.
Joe, are you there?
A mutter came through the door.
Kate said tonelessly, There’s a litter in the parlor.
Clean it up.
Anne hasn’t cleaned her room.
Give her one more warning.
Tell her it’s the last.
Eva got smart last night.
I’ll take care of her.
The mutter came through the door.
That’s all, said Kate.
The dirty pigs!
They’d rot if I didn’t watch them.
Go out and bring in the tea tray.
The bedroom was empty when Cal opened the door.
Pour the tea, said Kate.
It hurts my hands.
She put a chocolate in her mouth.
The light hurts my eyes.
I come in here to rest.
She said harshly, What’s the matter?
Don’t you want tea?
No, ma’am, said Cal, I don’t like tea.
She held the thin cup with her bandaged fingers.
What do you want?
Just wanted to look at me?
Are you satisfied?
How do I look?
I might have known you’d cover up.
Where’s your brother?
In school, I guess, or home.
What’s he like?
He looks more like you.
Oh, he does?
Well, is he like me ?
He wants to be a minister, said Cal.
When someone comes here, he’s got his guard up.
But in church a man’s wide open.
He means it, said Cal.
Fill my cup.
Is your brother dull?
He’s nice, said Cal.
I asked you if he’s dull.
No, ma’am, said Cal.
She settled back and lifted her cup.
How’s your father?
I don’t want to talk about him, Cal said.
You like him then?
I love him, said Cal.
And then she closed up and her control came back.
Don’t you want some candy?
Why did you do it?
Why did I do what?
Did he tell you that?
He didn’t tell us.
No, said Cal.
Why did you shoot him and go away?
You talk older than your age, she said.
But you don’t talk old enough.
Maybe you’d better run along and play—and wipe your nose.
Sometimes I work my brother over, he said.
I make him squirm, I’ve made him cry.
He doesn’t know how I do it.
I’m smarter than he is.
I don’t want to do it.
It makes me sick.
They thought they were so smart, she said.
They looked at me and thought they knew about me.
And I fooled them.
I fooled every one of them.
that’s when I fooled them best.
Charles, I really fooled them then.
My name is Caleb, Cal said.
Caleb got to the Promised Land.
That’s what Lee says, and it’s in the Bible.
He tried to tie me down that way.
Most people get tied down that way.
But nobody can hold me.
Nobody can trap me, she said.
I knew what he was doing.
Cal said, Why did you shoot him?
Because he tried to stop me.
I could have killed him but I didn’t.
I just wanted him to let me go.
Did you ever wish you’d stayed?
They never knew how I did it.
They were always so sure they were right.
And they never knew—no one ever knew.
A kind of realization came to her.
Sure, you’re my kind.
Maybe you’re the same.
Why wouldn’t you be?
Cal stood up and clasped his hands behind his back.
Did you ever feel that way?
She said, What am I doing, talking to kids!
Talking to snot-nosed kids, she said.
I must be crazy.
Kate said, What’s the matter with you?
She laughed softly.
But if it’s epilepsy—fits—you didn’t get it from me.
Cal spoke happily.
I’m going, he said.
I’m going now.
It’s all right.
What Lee said was true.
What did Lee say?
Cal said, I was afraid I had you in me.
You have, said Kate.
No, I haven’t.
I’m my own.
I don’t have to be you.
How do you know that?
I just know.
It just came to me whole.
If I’m mean, it’s my own mean.
This Chinaman has really fed you some pap.
What are you looking at me like that for?
Cal said, I don’t think the light hurts your eyes.
I think you’re afraid.
Go on, get out!
He had his hand on the doorknob.
I don’t hate you, he said.
But I’m glad you’re afraid.
She tried to shout Joe!
but her voice thickened to a croak.
Cal wrenched open the door and slammed it behind him.
They heard the stutter of light quick footsteps.
What in hell was that?
the girl asked.
God knows, said Joe.
Sometimes I think I’m seeing things.
Me too, said the girl.
Did I tell you Clara’s got bugs under her skin?
I guess she seen-the shadow of the needle, said Joe.
That’s the truth you said there, the girl agreed.
She spoke softly to herself.
Steady now, she said.
Don’t let it hit you.
Don’t think for a while.
The goddam snot-nose!
I’m glad you’re afraid.
It was before the lean-to was built.
Kate had collected the money Charles had left.
There was enough money now to go away.
She never felt quite well again.
New York seemed cold and very far away.
A letter came to her signed Ethel.
Who in hell was Ethel?
Ethel—there were hundreds of Ethels.
Ethels grew on every bush.
And this one scrawled illegibly on a lined pad.
Kate sat at her desk, watchful, suspicious, and confident.
It’s been a long time, she said.
I’ve been poorly, she said.
Her flesh had thickened and grown heavy all over her.
Her clothes had the strained cleanliness that means poverty.
Where are you—staying now?
Southern Pacific Hotel.
I got a room.
Oh, then you don’t work in a house now?
I couldn’t never get started again, said Ethel.
You shouldn’t of run me off.
Things are bad, she said.
First I had trouble when we got that new judge.
Ninety days, and I didn’t have no record—not here anyways.
I didn’t know I had it.
They forget you’re alive.
I just never could get started.
Kate nodded her head in cold and shallow sympathy.
She knew that Ethel was working up to the bite.
Just before it came Kate made a move.
I never let a friend down, she said.
Why don’t you go to a new town, start fresh?
It might change your luck.
She fanned the bills like a poker hand—four tens.
Her mouth began to work with emotion.
What do you mean?
Didn’t you get my letter?
Oh’ said Ethel.
Well, maybe it got lost in the mail.
They don’t take no care of things.
Anyways, I thought you might look after me.
I don’t feel good hardly ever.
Got a kind of weight dragging my guts down.
Always predicting things that come true.
Always dreaming stuff and it come out.
Fella says I should go in the business.
Says I’m a natural medium.
You remember that?
No, said Kate, I don’t.
Well, maybe you never noticed.
All the others did.
I told ’em lots of things and they come true.
What are you trying to say?
I had this-here dream.
Her eves flicked up at Kate’s cold face.
It wasn’t pitch-dark—moon was coming through a little.
And the dream thing was you.
I couldn’t see what you done.
Then you come creeping back.
Next thing I knew—why, Faye was dead.
Ethel waited until she was sure Kate would not speak.
Well, like I said, I always believed in my dreams.
Kate said lazily, So you took them to a doctor.
What did he say had been in the bottles?
Oh, I didn’t do nothing like that.
You should have, said Kate.
I don’t want to see nobody get in trouble.
I’ve had enough trouble myself.
I’ll tell you what I think, said Kate.
Don’t you start saying I’m nuts— Ethel began.
No, maybe you’re not, but you’re tired and you’re sick.
I told you I never let a friend down.
You can come back here.
You’ll have a bed and you’ll get your meals.
How would that be?
And a little spending money.
Ethel stirred uneasily.
No, ma’am, she said.
I don’t think I want to—sleep here.
I don’t carry that envelope around.
I left it with a friend.
What did you have in mind?
You said you lived at the Southern Pacific Hotel?
The night clerk’s a friend of mine.
He don’t never sleep when he’s on duty.
Kate said, Don’t wet your pants, Ethel.
Now wait a minute.
I’ll send it to you, said Kate.
Ethel clutched the money tightly in her hand.
She was bubbling over with triumph and good feeling.
I wouldn’t think of doing that, she said.
Not unless I had to.
The dark-haired man said, Pretty close to a hundred dollars.
The judge turned to the arresting officer.
How much did she have?
Ethel cried, I never seen this guy in my life.
The judge looked up from his papers.
Twice for prostitution and now robbery.
You’re costing too much.
I want you out of town by noon.
He turned to the officer.
Tell the sheriff to run her over the county line.
Do you understand?
Ethel said, Judge, I want to see you alone.
I got to see you, said Ethel.
This is a frame.
Everything’s a frame, said the judge.
She had nearly forgotten Faye.
The forcible recalling was simply an unpleasant memory.
Gradually, however, she found herself thinking about it.
And Sam Hamilton’s puzzled and merry eyes?
Her fingers began to hurt her.
It was a slow, listless night—a Tuesday night.
There weren’t even enough customers to put on the circus.
Kate knew how the girls felt about her.
They were desperately afraid of her.
She kept them that way.
But they trusted her, and that did matter.
There was no love involved and no respect.
As Kate walked about, the girls became elaborately casual.
Kate knew about that too and expected it.
Charles seemed to walk to the side and behind her.
Not that I know of.
I don’t know.
She seems nervous.
Well, there was some kind of rat race.
What was it?
Wait a minute!
I don’t know and you don’t know.
I get it.
Mind my own business.
You’re goddam right, said Joe.
Let’s keep it that way, shall we?
I don’t want to know, said Eloise.
Now you’re talking, Joe said.
Kate ranged back from her tour.
I’m going to bed, she said to Joe.
Don’t call me unless you have to.
Anything I can do?
Yes, make me a pot of tea.
Did you press that dress, Eloise?
You didn’t do it very well.
Kate was restless.
What about Charles?
And then it came to her.
Charles was clever.
In his crazy way Sam Hamilton was clever.
That was the fear-driven thought—there were clever people.
She worked it out very slowly.
What would I think and what would I do?
A rim of panic rose in her breast.
Why were the bottles broken and buried?
So it wasn’t a poison!
Then why bury them?
What had made her do that?
Wilde was dead.
But what kind of records did he keep?
She didn’t know.
What would happen?
She would know.
Maybe somebody else would know.
Kate knew perfectly well what her first thought would be.
What insanity had made her get Ethel floated?
Now she couldn’t be found.
Where was the glass now?
In an envelope—but where?
How could Ethel be found?
Ethel would know why and how she had been floated.
She didn’t need the money.
She had plenty.
Nobody could find her.
Then she built the lean-to and had it painted gray.
Her eyes burned after a trip to the town.
She spent more and more time in her little room.
She would not be protected then.
Business picked up and prices began to rise.
A charge of excitement ran through the country.
The Salinas Valley lived about as it always had.
Cal walked to school with Aron.
You look tired, Aron said.
I heard you come in last night.
What do you do so late?
I was walking around—thinking.
We could make some money for Father.
I’m going to college.
I wish I could go now.
Everybody is laughing at us.
I want to get out of town.
You act mad.
I’m not mad.
But I didn’t lose the money.
I didn’t have a crazy lettuce idea.
But people laugh at me just the same.
And I don’t know if there’s enough money for college.
He didn’t mean to lose the money.
But he lost it.
Do you think I don’t know it?
Aron swung around.
I couldn’t do it.
I think you could.
Why don’t you talk to the principal?
And I bet the Reverend Rolf would help you.
Aron said, I want to get out of this town.
I don’t ever want to come back.
They still call us Lettuce-heads.
They laugh at us.
How about Abra?
Abra will do what’s best.
Cal asked, Would she want you to go away?
Abra’s going to do what I want her to do.
Cal thought for a moment.
I’ll tell you what.
I’m going to try to make some money.
Sure I will.
Why, I’ll go and see the principal right away.
He quickened his steps.
Cal called, Aron, wait!
I don’t see what difference it makes.
No, I don’t, said Aron.
It sounds silly to me.
I can show her to you.
That would cut through and get inside of Aron.
Cal met Abra in the hall before the schoolbell rang.
What’s the matter with Aron?
I don’t know.
Yes, you do, he said.
He’s just in a cloud.
I think it’s that minister.
Does he walk home with you?
Sure he does.
But I can see right through him.
He’s wearing wings.
He’s still ashamed about the lettuce.
I know he is, said Abra.
I try to talk him out of it.
Maybe he’s enjoying it.
What do you mean?
Nothing, said Abra.
Adam turned in his chair.
Just want to see.
Just want to look around.
Does Aron want to go?
I want to go alone.
I don’t see why you shouldn’t.
Lee, do you see any reason why he shouldn’t go?
No, said Lee.
He studied Cal.
Thinking seriously of going to farming?
After that can I farm it?
How about school?
I’ll be through school.
Well, we’ll see, said Adam.
You might want to go to college.
Can you tell me what it’s about?
I just want to look around.
All right, I guess I’m left out.
Lee turned to go back into the house.
Then he called, Cal!
The boy stopped.
You worried, Cal?
I’ve got five thousand dollars if you ever need it.
Why would I need it?
I don’t know, said Lee.
I’m just a country boy.
And he liked the laugh that always followed.
Cal came in to see him one Saturday morning.
Seeing Will’s puzzled look, he said, I’m Cal Trask.
Lord, you’re getting to be a big boy.
Is your father down?
I came alone.
Well, sit down.
I don’t suppose you smoke.
Will slid a package of Murads across the desk.
Cal opened the box and then closed it.
I don’t think I will right now.
Will looked at the dark-faced boy and he liked him.
He thought, This boy is sharp.
He’s nobody’s fool.
There’s no money in that, said Will.
Farmers don’t make any money.
It’s the man who buys from him and sells.
You’ll never make any money farming.
Hamilton, you haven’t any children, have you?
And I’m sorry about that.
I guess I’m sorriest about that.
And then, What makes you ask?
Cal ignored the question.
Would you give me some advice?
Will felt a glow of pleasure.
If I can, I’ll be glad to.
What is it you want to know?
And then Cal did something Will Hamilton approved even more.
He used candor as a weapon.
He said, I want to make a lot of money.
I want you to tell me how.
Will overcame his impulse to laugh.
Everybody wants that, he said.
What do you mean by a lot of money?
Twenty or thirty thousand dollars.
said Will, and he screeched his chair forward.
And now he did laugh, but not in derision.
Cal smiled along with Will’s laughter.
Yes, sir, said Cal, I can.
I’ll tell you why, he said.
Will leaned his chair back in enjoyment.
My father lost a lot of money.
I know, said Will.
Why did you?
There were no guarantees, said Will.
A businessman has to protect himself.
If anything happened, he was finished.
And it happened.
Will gaped at him.
I want to.
Will said, Are you fond of him?
Each one without effort brought some gift into the family.
He thought of himself as slow, doltish, conservative, uninspired.
The others didn’t even know they needed him.
He thought the Hamiltons despised him for his one ability.
Don’t you feel well?
And now this boy came along.
Will understood him, felt him, sensed him, recognized him.
He forced his attention to the glass office.
Cal was sitting back in his chair, waiting.
Will did not know how long his silence had lasted.
I was thinking, he said lamely.
He made his voice stern.
You asked me something.
I’m a businessman.
I don’t give things away.
I sell them.
Will you tell me the truth?
I don’t know, said Cal.
I like that.
How do you know until you know the question?
I like that.
That’s smart—and honest.
Listen—you have a brother.
Does your father like him better than you?
Everybody does, said Cal calmly.
Everybody loves Aron.
At least—yes, I do.
What’s the at least’?
Sometimes I think he’s stupid but I like him.
Now how about your father?
I love him, said Cal.
And he loves your brother better.
I don’t know.
My father is good, he said.
If you do that, wouldn’t you be good?
No, said Cal.
I think bad.
Will had never met anyone who spoke so nakedly.
I don’t think I would answer it.
Here it is.
And it would be true.
That’s all I want to ask.
He could not remember when he had been so shaken.
And in Cal there was a cautious leap of triumph.
Let’s go outside, he said.
Let’s go for a drive.
The big motor idled with a deep whisper.
I don’t like to take a partner without money.
I can get money, said Cal.
Five thousand dollars.
You—I don’t believe it.
Cal didn’t answer.
I believe it, said Will.
That’s a good trick.
Where will you get it?
I won’t tell you, sir.
Will shook his head and laughed.
He was filled with pleasure.
He gunned his motor and then let it idle again.
I want you to listen.
Do you read the papers?
We’re going to be in this war any minute now.
That’s what it looks like.
Well, a lot of people think so.
Now, do you know the present price of beans?
I’m not sure.
What do you mean you’re not sure?
How do you know that?
But you don’t want to farm.
You’re too smart.
Your father’s tenant is named Rantani.
He’s a Swiss Italian, a good farmer.
He’s put nearly five hundred acres under cultivation.
So will every other farmer around here.
We could contract five thousand acres of beans.
But how can we be sure?
Will said, Are we partners?
How soon can you get five thousand dollars?
By next Wednesday.
Will, still holding Cal’s hand, said, Now we’re partners.
I have a contract with the British Purchasing Agency.
And I have a friend in the Quartermaster Corps.
When can you sell?
I’ll sell before we sign anything.
Yes sir, said Cal.
A war comes always to someone else.
Mexicans could shoot straight, goddam it!
And Villa’s horsemen had outridden and outlasted our town boys.
Somehow we didn’t connect Germans with Mexicans.
We went right back to our myths.
One American was as good as twenty Germans.
He wouldn’t dare interfere with our trade—but he did.
The war, at first anyway, was for other people.
And Mother of God!
that wasn’t true either.
It wasn’t much fun then.
The draftees wouldn’t look at their mothers.
They didn’t dare.
We’d never thought the war could happen to us.
Our men were being sent in without guns.
Troopships were sunk and the government wouldn’t tell us.
That Kaiser was a smart fellow.
He was getting ready to invade America.
But would Wilson tell us this?
He would not.
The nation and the Salinas Valley changed its songs.
She climbs upstairs and says her prayers—Oh, God!
He was immaculate.
I have to do it, he said.
The poor are forced to dress well.
You’ll be lending us money before we’re through.
That might be, said Lee.
This afternoon he set his heavy basket on the floor.
My cousin is in the firecracker and fan-tan business.
I thought you didn’t have any relatives, said Adam.
My cousin is a Suey Dong.
Ought to be good.
Good, Lee, good, he said.
You didn’t even listen, said Lee.
Adam drew himself upright.
Has some detail of their lives escaped you?
I only found out by accident, he said.
He hasn’t played for years.
Well, whatever he does.
Adam continued, Today I met Mr.
Kilkenny—you know, from the high school?
He thought I knew all about it.
Do you know what that boy is doing?
No, said Lee.
He’s covered all next year’s work.
And Kilkenny is confident that he will pass.
Now, what do you think of that?
Remarkable, said Lee.
Why is he doing it?
Why, to save a year!
What does he want to save it for?
Goddam it, Lee, he’s ambitious.
Can’t you understand that?
No, said Lee.
I never could.
Adam said, He never spoke of it.
I wonder if his brother knows.
I guess Aron wants it to be a surprise.
We shouldn’t mention it until he does.
I guess you’re right.
Do you know, Lee?
proud of him.
This makes me feel good.
I wish Cal had some ambition.
Maybe he has, said Lee.
Maybe he has some kind of a secret too.
God knows we haven’t seen much of him lately either.
Cal’s trying to find himself, said Lee.
I guess this personal hide-and-seek is not unusual.
And some people are it’ all their lives—hopelessly it’.
Just think, said Adam.
A whole year’s work ahead.
A gold watch, said Lee.
That’s right, said Adam.
What should it say?
The jeweler will tell you, said Lee.
Winter melon soup, said Lee.
If we’re careful and he doesn’t develop expensive tastes.
He wouldn’t, Adam said.
I didn’t think I would—but I have.
Lee inspected the sleeve of his coat with admiration.
The rectory of St.
Paul’s Episcopal Church was large and rambling.
It had been built for ministers with large families.
Rolf was fond of Aron.
Their discussions were long and close and personal.
I know I am criticized, Mr.
When I have a church I’ll do it too.
It requires great tact, said Mr.
Someplace to withdraw.
Sometimes I feel dirty.
I know how you feel, Mr.
Rolf said earnestly.
But there I cannot go along with you.
Perhaps I shouldn’t tell you this.
But there is a kind of glory in it.
I don’t think you can see her from the choir.
She is off at an angle.
Yes, you can see her.
Who is she?
Well, you’ll have to learn these things.
I made very discreet inquiries and you would never guess.
She is the—well—the owner of a house of ill fame.
Here in Salinas?
Here in Salinas.
Rolf leaned forward.
Aron, I can see your revulsion.
You must get over that.
Don’t forget our Lord and Mary Magdalene.
What does she want here?
Perhaps what we have to offer—salvation.
It will require great tact.
I can see how it will be.
And mark my words—these people are timid.
That’s what we are for, Aron.
That’s what we are for.
Rolf controlled his breathing with difficulty.
I pray God I may not fail, he said.
No one knew anything about huge and general war.
Lee had his instructions.
We’ll want to make a party of it, Adam said.
What would you think of champagne?
Very nice, said Lee.
Did you ever read von Clausewitz?
Who is he?
Not very reassuring reading, said Lee.
One bottle of champagne?
It’s just for toasts, you know.
Makes a party of it.
It didn’t occur to Adam that Aron might fail.
One afternoon Aron came in and asked Lee, Where’s father?
I won’t be in for dinner, said Aron.
Rolf asked me to have dinner at the rectory.
That’s nice, he said.
Can I get a bath?
He got into my cologne, said Cal.
I can still smell him.
It must be quite a party, Adam said.
I don’t blame him for wanting to celebrate.
That was a hard job.
Didn’t he tell you?
He passed them.
Oh, yes—the exams, said Adam.
Yes, he told me.
A fine job.
I’m proud of him.
I think I’ll get him a gold watch.
Cal said sharply, He didn’t tell you!
Oh, yes—yes, he did.
He told me this morning.
What happened to you?
I went for a walk.
What’s the matter with Aron?
I don’t know.
He seems to have some kind of grudge.
Want to walk to the post office with me?
What are you sitting out here for?
I’m going to beat the hell out of him.
Don’t do it, said Lee.
Because I don’t think you can.
He’d slaughter you.
I guess you’re right, said Cal.
The son of a bitch!
Watch your language.
I guess I’ll walk along with you.
Did you ever read von Clausewitz?
I never even heard of him.
I saved you from a licking, Lee said.
I’m going to bed.
I want to talk to you.
Why didn’t you tell your father you passed the tests?
He wouldn’t understand.
You’ve got a bug up your ass.
I don’t like that kind of language.
Why do you think I used it?
I am not profane by accident.
Aron, your father has been living for this.
How did he know about it?
You should have told him yourself.
This is none of your business.
I want you to tell him.
I won’t do it.
What do you mean?
It’s one of the most embarrassing things in the world.
Then you’re really in trouble all around.
What are you talking about?
Isn’t that ridiculous?
Aron tried to pass.
Aron nervously backed away from him.
Thank heaven that’s over, he said.
It would have been awful.
You always used to tell me.
Suddenly Aron broke down.
I want to go away.
It’s a dirty town.
No, it isn’t.
It’s just the same as other places.
I don’t belong here.
I wish we hadn’t ever come here.
I don’t know what’s the matter with me.
I want to go away.
His voice rose to a wail.
You’re growing up.
Maybe that’s it, he said softly.
But that’s not the worst.
We think everybody is seeing into us.
Then dirt is very dirty and purity is shining white.
Aron, it will be over.
Wait only a little while and it will be over.
Yes, I can help you.
Make it exciting.
Go through the motions.
Sam Hamilton said that.
Pretend it’s true and maybe it will be.
Go through the motions.
And go to bed.
I’ve got to bake a cake—for breakfast.
And, Aron—your father left a present on your pillow.
Aron and Abra had fenced themselves in with themselves.
With Aron gone, she attached herself to the other Trasks.
About Cal she couldn’t decide.
He seemed to be in a perpetual contest with her.
Aron was lonely at Stanford.
His letters were drenched with lonesome longing for his girl.
There was no subject she could not discuss with Lee.
There Lee was different also.
Abra wasn’t aware that she spoke exclusively of herself.
Even thin they were moon-faced.
She said, Maybe it was there all along.
I don’t know.
He never talked much about his father.
It was after Mr.
Trask had the—you know—the lettuce.
Aron was angry then.
People were laughing at him.
Lee’s whole mind popped back.
Laughing at Aron?
Why at him?
He didn’t have anything to do with it.
Well, that’s the way he felt.
Do you want to know what I think?
Of course, said Lee.
I figured this out and I’m not quite finished figuring.
Lee’s eyes opened wide and then drooped again.
Do you figure Cal is that way too?
Then why Aron?
Well, I haven’t got that yet.
My father hates turnips.
He always did.
Never came from anything.
Turnips make him mad, real mad.
I don’t think he ever forgave her.
He can forgive her because she said turnips.
And then afterward he found out.
Why, he might have murdered her.
I guess so.
And I think he always blamed his father.
I don’t know.
That’s what I think.
You do get around, don’t you?
Of course you should.
Shall I make some fudge?
We still have some.
What can I do?
You can pound flour into the top round.
Will you eat with us?
I’m going to a birthday party, thank you.
Do you think he’ll be a minister?
How do I know?
Maybe it’s just an idea.
Use the back side of the knife, he said.
She hoped he hadn’t heard her.
I shouldn’t say it.
You should say anything you want to.
You don’t have to explain.
Tap-tap—I shouldn’t talk like this—tap-tap.
He goes all one way, she said over the pounding.
If it’s church it’s got to be high church.
He was talking about how priests shouldn’t be married.
That’s not the way his last letter sounded, Lee observed.
That was before.
Her knife stopped its pounding.
Her face was young perplexed pain.
Lee, I’m not good enough for him.
Now, what do you mean by that?
I’m not being funny.
He doesn’t think about me.
I’m not like that—not like the made-up one.
What’s she like?
Just absolutely pure.
Nothing but pure—never a bad thing.
I’m not like that.
Nobody is, said Lee.
He doesn’t know me.
He doesn’t even want to know me.
He wants that—white—ghost.
Lee rubbed a piece of cracker.
Don’t you like him?
 ’Course I like him.
I’m going to be his wife.
But I want him to like me too.
I used to think he knew me.
Now I’m not sure he ever did.
Maybe he’s going through a hard time that isn’t permanent.
You’re a smart girl—very smart.
I’ll get mad or I’ll smell bad—or something else.
He’ll find out.
Maybe not, said Lee.
Humans just do smell bad sometimes.
She moved toward the table.
Don’t spill flour on my floor, he said.
What do you wish?
It’s from my figuring out.
That might be.
And then you think he dumped it all on you.
Suppose he wouldn’t like you then?
I’d rather take a chance on that, she said.
I’d rather be myself.
She went back to work.
The beating stopped.
He knew she was looking at him.
He sighed and gave it up.
He smiled shyly.
Abra, let me tell you about myself.
I’m a servant.
These three you know.
I’m tired and I’m cowardly.
You’re not— she began.
Be silent, he said.
I am so cowardly.
I will not put my finger in any human pie.
What do you mean?
Abra, is your father mad at anything except turnips?
Her face went stubborn.
I asked you a question.
You did not ask a question, Abra.
I guess you think I’m too young— Abra began.
No, Abra, age has nothing to do with it.
The girl smiled at him.
I’m clever, she said.
Shall I be clever?
God help me—no, Lee protested.
I have enough sins to trouble me.
Please forgive me.
The yellow skin on his hand was tight and glazed.
Abra said, My father wanted a boy.
I guess he hates turnips and girls.
He tells everyone how he gave me my crazy name.
And though I called another, Abra came.
Lee smiled at her.
You’re such a nice girl, he said.
I’ll buy some turnips tomorrow if you’ll come to dinner.
Abra asked softly, Is she alive?
Yes, said Lee.
The front door slammed, and Cal came into the kitchen.
Lee, is father home?
No, not yet.
What are you grinning all over for?
Cal handed him a check.
That’s for you.
Lee looked at it.
I didn’t want interest, he said.
I might want to borrow it back.
You won’t tell me where you got it?
I’ve got a good idea— His eyes flicked to Abra.
I have to go home now, she said.
Cal said, She might as well be in on it.
I’ve got a present for my father.
What is it?
I won’t tell.
You’ll find out then.
Does Lee know?
Yes, but he won’t tell.
I don’t think I ever saw you so—gay, Abra said.
I don’t think I ever saw you gay at all.
She discovered in herself a warmth for him.
After Abra had gone Cal sat down.
After, said Lee.
Have you really got the money?
Fifteen thousand dollars.
You mean, did I steal it?
Honestly, said Cal.
Remember how we had champagne for Aron?
We’ll get champagne.
And—well, we’ll maybe decorate the dining room.
Maybe Abra’ll help.
Do you really think your father wants money?
Why wouldn’t he?
I hope you’re right, said Lee.
How have you been doing in school?
Not very well.
I’ll pick up after Thanksgiving, said Cal.
Hello, Abra, he said.
You make good fudge.
That last was dry.
It should be creamy.
Lee is just crazy about you.
What have you done to him?
What’s the matter with Aron?
What do you mean?
He just seems to think only about himself.
I don’t think that’s very new.
Have you had a fight with him?
Not get married to you?
I can’t imagine that.
Then who are they to?
It’s like they were to—himself.
Cal said, I know about the willow tree.
She didn’t seem surprised.
Are you mad at Aron?
No, not mad.
I just can’t find him.
I don’t know him.
Wait around, said Cal.
Maybe he’s going through something.
I wonder if I’ll be all right.
How do I know?
Yes, he said.
Did Aron tell you?
No, not Aron.
Well, why do you go there?
He walked beside her and did not answer.
Tell me, she said.
What’s it to you?
Is it because you’re bad?
What’s it sound like to you?
I’m not good either, she said.
You’re crazy, said Cal.
Aron will knock that out of you.
Do you think he will?
Why, sure, said Cal.
He’s got to.
Hate cannot live alone.
Joe early developed a gentle protective love for Joe.
He comforted and flattered and cherished Joe.
And gradually Joe became proof against wrong.
Don’t believe nobody.
The bastards are after you.
Keep your mouth shut.
Don’t stick your neck out.
Keep your ears open.
Go at everything roundabout.
Don’t never trust no dame about nothing.
Put your faith in dough.
Everybody wants it.
Everybody will sell out for it.
There were other rules, but they were refinements.
She had no illusions about him.
In her business Joes were necessary.
He knew they were there because she was a woman.
He developed an admiration for her based on fear.
She fed him, clothed him, gave him orders, punished him.
Kate don’t make no mistakes, Joe said.
This went beyond thought and became a habit pattern.
It was Kate’s business and she was smart.
She could almost feel her joints thicken and knot.
Sometimes she used memories.
She built Mr.
Kate went into her feeling about Faye.
Did she hate or love her?
Did she pity her?
Was she sorry she had killed her?
Kate inched over her own thoughts like a measuring worm.
She found she had no feeling about Faye.
She neither liked nor disliked her or her memory.
The first voice would be Ethel, and the second Trixie.
Kate remembered her own half-humorous reaction.
Yes, the first voice must have been Ethel.
Why is she a lousy old bag?
Isn’t it because you made a mistake?
Why did you float her?
Kate wondered where Ethel was.
Then there’d be two noses sniffing instead of one.
Yes, but what difference would that make?
Now an agency man—no—no agencies.
Kate spent many hours with Ethel.
It shouldn’t have been an even hundred dollars.
That was obvious.
And how about the sheriff?
What did Ethel tell the deputy who drove her out?
Ethel was a lazy old bat.
Maybe she had stayed in Watsonville.
Maybe she came to Salinas sometimes.
She might be in Salinas right now.
She might have gone on to Santa Cruz.
Joe could look there too.
It wouldn’t take him long.
If he found her they could get her back somehow.
Ethel was a fool.
Lock the door.
Leave a Do not disturb sign.
Take a bus.
Nobody saw anybody on the night buses.
Well, she could make herself go.
It would stop all this wondering.
Strange she hadn’t thought of sending Joe before.
That was perfect.
That was the kind easiest to handle.
Ethel was stupid.
That made her hard to handle.
If she got sick enough there might be a chance.
But very profoundly Joe was afraid of her.
Morning, he said.
I’m not going to sit up for it, Joe.
Just give me the tea.
You’ll have to hold it.
They get better after a flare up.
Looks like you had a bad night.
No, said Kate.
I had a good night.
I’ve got some new medicine.
How was the night?
I almost came to tell you last night, said Joe.
Hick came in from King City.
Just sold his crop.
Bought out the house.
Dropped seven hundred not counting what he give the girls.
What was his name?
I don’t know.
But I hope he comes in again.
You should get the name, Joe.
I’ve told you that.
He was cagey.
All the more reason to get his name.
Didn’t any of the girls frisk him?
I don’t know.
Well, find out.
I’ll find out, he assured her.
I got enough to go on.
You like it here?
she asked softly.
I got it good here.
You could have it better—or worse, she said.
I got it real nice here.
She moistened her lips with her arrow-shaped tongue.
You and I can work together, she said.
He waited patiently.
She took a good long time to begin.
I didn’t take nothing.
I didn’t say you did.
I’ll get to it, Joe.
Do you remember that old buzzard we had to move?
You mean Ethel what’s-her-name?
That’s the one.
She got away with something.
I didn’t know it then.
A coldness crept into her voice.
Not your business, Joe.
Listen to me!
You’re a smart fellow.
Where would you go to look for her?
She was pretty beat up.
She wouldn’t go far.
An old hustler don’t go far.
You think she might be in Watsonville?
There or maybe Santa Cruz.
She caressed her fingers tenderly.
Would you like to make five hundred, Joe?
You want I should find her?
Just find her.
When you do, don’t let her know.
Just bring me the address.
Just tell me where she is.
Okay, said Joe.
She must of rolled you good.
That’s not your business, Joe.
Yes, ma’am, he said.
You want I should start right off?
Make it quick, Joe.
Might be a little tough, he said.
It’s been a long time.
That’s up to you.
I’ll go to Watsonville this afternoon.
That’s good, Joe.
She was thoughtful.
Joe, did—did she do anything—well, peculiar—that day in court?
Said she was framed like they always do.
I got to tell you something.
Kate said, Well, what was it?
He had been too late.
His mind leaped for safety.
There’s something, he said to gain time.
I’m trying to think.
Her voice was edged and anxious.
Well— He had it.
She said she had relatives in San Luis Obispo.
Kate leaned quickly toward him.
And the cops said it was too damn far.
You’re smart, Joe.
Where will you go first?
Watsonville, he said.
I got a friend in San Luis.
He’ll look around for me.
I’ll give him a ring.
Joe, she said sharply.
I want this quiet.
Her next words jarred his stomach loose from his backbone.
He tried to answer before his throat tightened.
Not a thing, he said.
Come back as soon as you can, Kate said.
Tell Helen to come in.
She’ll take over for you.
The overhead light shining in his face didn’t bother him.
He didn’t notice it.
Well, he’d underrated her.
Seaport towns—always good.
And then—now wait a minute.
Think about it.
Ethel didn’t steal nothing.
She had something.
Kate was scared of Ethel.
Might be able to use that.
with her holding that jailbreak over him.
Joe wasn’t going to serve out the limit with penalties.
But no harm in thinking about it.
Was that a bad bet?
No need to decide.
She knew it before and didn’t turn him in.
Suppose she thought he was a good dog.
Maybe Ethel might be a hole-card.
Now—wait—just think about it.
Maybe it was the breaks.
Maybe he ought to draw his hand and see.
But she was so goddam smart.
Joe wondered if he could play against her.
But how, if he just played along?
Joe sat up and filled his glass full.
He turned off his light and raised his shade.
And the whisky muttered in his ears.
It might be the breaks.
God knows, Joe had waited long enough.
No need to decide right now.
With the third glass of whisky the pint was empty.
But then his discipline took over.
That way a man never got in trouble.
He put the street out of his mind.
He indulged it now.
No luck—he never got the breaks.
The big shots got the breaks.
Cops came right in his house and got him.
In school he didn’t have no luck neither.
Teachers against him, principal against him.
Guy couldn’t take that crap.
Had to get out.
He wept quietly until he fell asleep.
Joe won the last game and racked his cue.
He handed his friend two ten-dollar bills.
Hell, said his friend, I don’t want your money.
Take it, said Joe.
It ain’t like I give you anything.
You give me plenty.
Can’t tell me what you want her for?
I’m jus’ doing a job of work.
Well, that’s all I can do.
Seems like there was this convention—what was it?
or maybe Owls.
I got it stuck in my mind.
Give Santa Cruz a whirl.
I got a few acquaintances, said Joe.
Look up H.
Mahler, Hal Mahler.
He runs Hal’s poolroom.
Got a game in back.
Thanks, said Joe.
I don’t want your money.
It ain’t my money—buy a cigar, said Joe.
The bus dropped him two doors from Hal’s place.
It was suppertime but the stud game was still going.
Stick around till the game breaks, he said.
Care to sit in?
How many playing for you, Hal?
I’ll play for you.
Five bucks an hour, said Hal.
An’ ten per cent if I win?
Sandy-haired fella Williams is the house.
Two rib steaks and french fries.
You want soup?
Hal asked Joe.
And no french fries.
They bind me up.
Me too, said Hal.
But I eat them just the same.
I don’t get enough exercise.
Hal was a silent man until he was eating.
He rarely spoke unless his mouth was full.
What’s your pitch?
he asked around steak.
Just a job.
I make a hundred bucks and you get twenty-five—okay?
Got to have like proof—like papers?
Be good but I’ll get by without them.
She wasn’t no good.
I didn’t take twenty a week off her.
Nice fella, Bill.
We got a nice force here.
Ethel was not a bad woman—lazy, sloppy, but good-hearted.
She wanted dignity and importance.
She would have liked more dignity.
Get loaded with ink an’ they go nuts.
I don’t see how else she’d get in the water.
Maybe she jumped off the pier?
said Hal through potatoes.
She was too blamed lazy to kill herself.
You want to check?
It was her, he said.
Want a piece of pie?
He needed more time to think.
He wanted to look disappointed but not too disappointed.
Kate was so goddam clever.
Let her lead.
Just follow suit.
She was about as wide open as a fist.
And he answered his caution savagely, Breaks.
How many breaks did I ever get?
Just play it close.
Let her do the talking.
No harm in that.
Not if I play ’em close.
What I got to lose?
What breaks did I ever get?
Kate was feeling better.
The new medicine seemed to be doing her some good.
She planned to have a boiled egg for breakfast.
Lying high against the pillows, she studied her face.
The rest had done wonders.
The difference in her rested face was amazing.
She looked ten years younger.
She opened her lips and looked at her teeth.
Time to go for a cleaning.
She took care of her teeth.
It was remarkable how young she looked, Kate thought.
Just one night’s sleep and she snapped back.
That was another thing that fooled them.
They thought she would be weak and delicate.
She smiled to herself—delicate like a steel trap.
And it paid off.
She had an angelic face.
the hell was his name—Alec?
Only the hard outside had been brushed by contacts.
She chuckled—mother of two sons—and she looked like a child.
His brother knew.
Might be too true.
Some people believed it.
And not smart bastard either—born in holy wedlock.
Kate laughed aloud.
She felt good.
She was having a good time.
The smart one—the dark one—bothered her.
He was like Charles.
Kate thought of her fear of Ethel.
How sick she must- have been—the poor dumb old bag!
How would it be to murder her with kindness?
Keep her close.
A funny notion came to Kate.
Stay in the house, dear.
I trust you.
Look after things.
Go to bed.
Let me fill your glass.
I got these new sweets for you.
Would you like to take the box to bed?
These cashews are nice, don’t you think?
Or how about a tapeworm?
Did anyone ever use tapeworms?
He wasn’t smart.
He couldn’t protect himself.
The dark brother might be dangerous.
She had felt his quality.
Cal had beaten her.
Before she went away she would teach him a lesson.
Maybe he could come to her in New York.
No one could fail to know.
They could go together to Ethel’s funeral.
He pushed the door closed with his knee.
Want it there?
I’ll have it right here.
Four and a half minutes on the egg.
I don’t want it gooey.
You must feel better, ma’am.
I do, she said.
That new medicine is wonderful.
You look dragged by dogs, Joe.
Don’t you feel well?
Four and a half minutes?
And if there’s a good apple—a crisp apple—bring that too.
Maybe she knew.
He’d have to be careful.
she couldn’t hate him for something he didn’t know.
No crime in that.
Back in her room he said, Didn’t have no apples.
He said this was a good pear.
I’d like that even better, said Kate.
How is it?
You look good, he said.
I feel good.
You look like hell.
What’s the matter?
Joe went into it warily.
Ma’am, there ain’t nobody needs five hundred like I do.
What are you trying to say?
You couldn’t find her—is that it?
Tell me about it.
Joe put an artificial joy on his face.
Thanks, he said.
I’m in a spot.
I need it.
Well, I looked in Pajaro and Watsonville.
Got a smell of her there but she was gone.
Kate tasted the egg and added more salt.
No, said Joe.
I went it blind there.
No idea where she went?
Joe fiddled with his fingers.
Come on, she said at last.
You got something—what is it?
Well, it ain’t much.
I don’t know what to think of it.
I’ll think, she said sharply.
Might not even be true.
For Christ’s sake!
she said angrily.
Well, I talked to the last guy that seen her.
Did you get his grandmother’s name?
she asked sarcastically.
Then she dropped out of sight.
This guy Joe didn’t know nothing more.
Kate was startled out of control.
Whatever it was, Joe had something.
He had got the breaks at last.
She looked up from her lap and her twisted fingers.
We’ll forget the old fart, she said.
You’ll get your five hundred, Joe.
She had believed him.
I sure will.
Want me to dig into it?
It isn’t that important.
He smiled to himself.
And instantly he began to work out the future course.
Let her relax, and then bring up Ethel again.
This was seriously considered in articles and in arguments.
The Germans were not stopped.
General Pershing would save us if we could be saved.
He was the epitome of a perfect soldier.
No one knew what he really thought.
His heart couldn’t take it.
They had buttons too.
And everybody knitted something for someone.
These belts were handsome and only officers could wear them.
A good one cost as much as twenty-five dollars.
One thing we resisted for a long time, though.
Wrist-watches were just too silly.
We had our internal enemies too, and we exercised vigilance.
For about twenty years Mr.
Fenchel had done hand tailoring in Salinas.
It was German.
We had our own personal German.
That was too easy a way to cover up.
The Home Guard wouldn’t take him in.
We used every cruelty we could think of on Mr.
He was our German.
My little sister and I did our part with Mr.
Fenchel looked up and saw us moving toward him.
We stopped in the gutter as he came by.
He broke into a smile and said, Gut efning, Chon.
Gut efning, Mary.
Didn’t even try to pretend he wasn’t.
He just stood there sobbing.
And do you know?
We felt horrible.
I still do when I think of it.
That took strong men—about thirty of them.
They tore down Mr.
Of course that made Watsonville get busy.
He had an accent.
Our pattern of life changed in the usual manner.
Wages and prices went up.
It wasn’t all bad or cheap or hysterical.
There was heroism too.
There is no dignity in death in battle.
He was the logical man for the job.
Adam didn’t remember his war very well.
But Adam’s pictures were frozen.
Adam worked hard and honestly and sadly.
He felt like a hanging judge who hates the gallows.
A sour-pussed associate could make him sick.
Relax, he told Adam.
You’re trying to carry the weight of the war.
Now, look—it’s not your responsibility.
You got put in here with a set of rules.
Just follow the rules and relax.
You aren’t running the war.
I know, he said wearily.
Oh, I know that!
It’s not your business, Adam.
Why don’t you take a few drinks at night?
Go to a movie—sleep on it.
You pass boys I could be talked into letting off.
I know, said Adam.
I wonder how long it will last?
I see what you mean, he said softly.
Adam looked at him, startled.
What do I mean?
Now don’t get huffy.
I never thought I was lucky before, just having girls.
Hate to what?
I’d resign, said Adam.
I can see that.
No, said Adam.
I’d resign because I couldn’t reject them.
A man couldn’t let his own go free.
His face was querulous.
No, he said, you’re right.
A man couldn’t.
How’s Aron doing at Stanford?
He’ll be home for Thanksgiving.
I’d like to see him.
I saw Cal on the street last night.
There’s a smart boy.
Cal didn’t take college tests a year ahead, said Adam.
Well, maybe that’s not what he’s cut out for.
I didn’t go to college.
No, said Adam.
I went into the army.
Well, it’s a good experience.
Good night, Henry, he said.
Walking home, Adam pondered his responsibility.
I have a hunger for some garlic bread, Lee said.
I like it with steak, said Adam.
We’re having steak.
Was there any mail?
I forgot to look in the box.
They entered the house and Lee went to the kitchen.
Go on, said Lee.
I would rather have the whole thing at once.
Is it responsibility or blame that bothers you?
I don’t want blame.
Sometimes responsibility is worse.
It doesn’t carry any pleasant egotism.
What was that word?
Now I see.
The word was timshel.
I remember Sam Hamilton felt good about it.
It set him free, said Lee.
All great and precious things are lonely.
What is the word again?
He was miserable.
Leland Stanford University was not like that.
He had made a mistake.
He made a compact with himself.
He might never come back.
And it was evening.
He could hide from ugliness—in the evening.
He looked at Joe and tried to place him.
I know you, he said.
Don’t tell me.
Joe edged away.
He was wary of people who knew him.
Wait a minute.
I got it.
You work at Kate’s.
Joe sighed with relief.
He had thought Alf might have known him earlier.
That’s right, he said shortly.
Never forget a face, said Alf.
Seen you when I built that crazy lean-to for Kate.
Now why in hell did she want that for?
Wanted it dark, said Joe, Eyes bother her.
He hardly ever believed anything simple or good about anybody.
He jerked his head back at Muller’s.
Well, it’s a milestone, he said.
Nearly all the old-timers gone.
When Fartin’ Jenny goes that’ll be the end.
And Jenny’s getting along.
Joe was restless.
He wanted to get away—and Alf knew he did.
Everybody is a gossip at heart.
It occurred to.
him that he didn’t know much about Kate’s place lately.
The old days was pretty good, he said.
 ’Course you’re just a kid.
I got to meet a fella, said Joe.
Alf pretended not to hear him.
You take Faye, he said.
Nobody really knows how Kate come to own it.
What was they suspicious about?
Hell, you know how people talk.
Probably nothing in it.
But I got to admit it looked kind of funny.
Like to have a beer?
Now you got something there, said Alf.
I ain’t as young as I was.
Funeral makes me thirsty.
The Nigger was quite a citizen.
I could tell you stuff about her.
I’ve knew her for thirty-five—no, thirty-seven years.
Who was Faye?
They went into Mr.
Kate might be the wife of Adam Trask.
He hid that quickly—Trask might want to pay off.
The Faye thing might be too hot to touch.
Joe had to think about that—alone.
Joe had not played ball.
Wonder who would have a line on him?
Alf said finally, Understand, I like Kate.
Probably nothing to all the palaver about her.
She’s got a real bad eye.
I get along fine, said Joe.
I had a funny idea, he said.
It was when I built that lean-to without no window.
Me and her get along just fine, said Joe.
I got to meet a guy.
Joe went to his room to think.
He was uneasy.
He thought somebody had been going through his things.
Just came to him.
There was nothing to find.
It made him nervous.
He tried to arrange the things he had heard.
What’s got into Kate?
She’s been sick.
I don’t mean that.
Was you maybe shaking up a little bourbon in it?
Just vanilla extract.
She can’t talk like that to me.
She did, didn’t she?
Well, I won’t take it.
Oh, yes, you will, said Joe.
Get out, Thelma!
What do you care?
I don’t, said Thelma.
You son of a bitch.
I’ve been sick.
But I’m well again or very nearly well.
Just a symptom.
I think you’ve been slipping.
His mind scurried for a hiding place.
Well, I been busy, he said.
Doing that stuff for you.
You know—about Ethel.
Okay, said Joe.
And then it came without his expecting it.
I met a fella yesterday said he seen her.
At the end of it Kate asked softly, Where?
She turned her swivel chair slowly around to face him.
I shouldn’t have let you work in the dark, Joe.
I thought she’d done something to me.
A melancholy came into her voice.
I was wrong.
I found out later.
It’s been working on me ever since.
She didn’t do anything to me.
Find her for me, Joe.
I’ll try, ma’am.
And, Joe—if you need any money, let me know.
Need any money?
Not right now, ma’am.
You go ahead.
That’s all, Joe.
He wanted to hug himself.
Look out for a soup carrier, Joe’s father had said.
Joe said under his breath, A soup carrier.
I thought she was smarter than that.
No—a soup carrier.
Kate sat at her desk.
A dull weariness came over her.
Her temples beat with pounding blood.
As soon as Kate stepped inside the talk stopped instantly.
Is something the matter, Miss Kate?
she asked fearfully.
Nothing’s the matter.
You went to the Nigger’s funeral.
Didn’t you want me to?
I don’t care about that.
Tell me about it.
What about it?
Tell me what you remember—how it was.
How do you mean?
I don’t know.
Made you feel—I can’t say it.
I don’t know how to say it.
Maybe you said it.
What did she wear?
They didn’t bury her naked, did they?
A struggle of effort crossed Helen’s face.
I don’t know, she said at last.
I don’t remember.
Did you go to the cemetery?
Nobody did—except him.
Day before Thanksgiving.
Bound to be slow.
I’d forgotten, said Kate.
Get back out.
It was comfort and reassurance.
Cal said, Why don’t we let Abra go alone?
He’ll want to see her first.
So it doesn’t matter whether we go or not.
He’ll be changed.
I want to see what change there is.
Lee said, He’s only been gone a couple of months.
He can’t be very changed, nor much older.
He’ll be changed.
Experience will do that.
If you go we’ll all have to go, said Cal.
Don’t you want to see your brother?
Adam asked sternly.
He will too, said Adam.
Don’t you underrate Aron.
Lee threw up his hands.
I guess we all go, he said.
Can you imagine?
He’ll know so many new things.
I wonder if he’ll talk different.
You can tell a Harvard man from a Princeton man.
At least that’s what they say.
I’ll listen, said Lee.
I wonder what dialect they speak at Stanford.
 He smiled at Cal.
Adam didn’t think it was funny.
Did you put some fruit in his room?
He loves fruit.
Pears and apples and muscat grapes, said Lee.
Yes, he loves muscats.
I remember he loves muscats.
Abra was already there.
I can’t come to dinner tomorrow, Lee, she said.
My father wants me home.
I’ll come as soon after as I can.
You’re a little breathless, said Lee.
I guess I am, said Lee.
There was pride in it, and relief too.
What’s wrong with an hour?
But it isn’t silly, this preoccupation with small time units.
On the way home they all talked at once.
Well, how are you?
You look fine.
Abra, you’re so pretty.
I am not.
Why did you cut your hair?
But you have such nice hair.
Adam said, Coffee, Lee?
I made it before we left.
It’s on the simmer.
He had the cups laid out too.
Adam did say, I’ll want to hear all about it.
Will you get good marks?
Finals aren’t until next month, Father.
Oh, I see.
Well, you’ll get good marks, all right.
I’m sure you will.
I’ll bet you’re tired, said Adam.
Well, we can talk tomorrow.
Lee said, I’ll bet he’s not.
I’ll bet he’d like to be alone.
Adam looked at Lee and said, Why, of course—of course.
Do you think we should all go to bed?
Abra solved it for them.
I can’t stay out long, she said.
Aron, why don’t you walk me home?
We’ll be together tomorrow.
On the way Aron clung to her arm.
There’s going to a frost, he said.
You’re glad to be back.
Yes, I am.
I have a lot to talk about.
I hope you think so.
You sound serious.
It is serious.
When do you have to go back?
Not until Sunday night.
We’ll have lots of time.
I want to tell you some things too.
Would you mind not coming in tonight?
I’ll tell you later.
I want to know now.
Well, my father’s got one of his streaks.
He was turning shy.
I shouldn’t have told you that tonight.
Yes, you should, he said slowly.
Tell me the truth.
Do you still—want to be with me?
Yes, I do.
Then all right.
I’ll go away now.
We’ll talk tomorrow.
She thought, I must be crazy.
I’ve been imagining things.
His thoughts would not coagulate.
He got up and softly opened his door.
There was a light under Cal’s door.
He tapped and went in without waiting for a reply.
Cal sat at a new desk.
Yes, said Cal and left it at that.
Can I talk to you?
Come on in.
Talk low or Father will come in.
He hates to miss a moment.
Aron sat down on the bed.
No, not trouble.
I just wanted to talk to you.
Cal, I don’t want to go on at college.
Cal’s head jerked around.
I just don’t like it.
You haven’t told Father, have you?
He’ll be disappointed.
It’s bad enough that I don’t want to go.
What do you want to do?
I thought I’d like to take over the ranch.
How about Abra?
Cal studied him.
The ranch has got a lease to run.
Well, I was just thinking about it.
Cal said, There’s no money in farming.
I don’t want much money.
Just to get along.
That’s not good enough for me, said Cal.
Cal felt older and surer than his brother.
He felt protective toward him.
Then when you finish we can be partners.
I’ll have one kind of thing and you’ll have another.
That might be pretty good.
I don’t want to go back.
Why do I have to go back?
Because Father wants you to.
That won’t make me go.
Sleep on it, he said quickly.
Don’t do anything now.
Aron got up and moved toward the door.
Who’s the present for?
It’s for Father.
You’ll see it tomorrow—after dinner.
It’s not Christmas.
No, said Cal, it’s better than Christmas.
The package might have been a handkerchief.
But he could not sleep.
He was excited and at the same time shy.
He wished the day was over and the gift given.
He went over what he planned to say.
This is for you.
What is it?
From then on he didn’t know what would happen.
Young men got the cream of everything.
There was a good business.
Those wops were getting rich.
Old Martin called to Cal, Got a cigarette, young fella?
Cal stopped and took out his cardboard box of Murads.
Oh, fancy ones!
I ain’t got a match either.
Young fellas gets the cream, he said.
They won’t let me drive it.
Why, the new sweeper.
Ain’t you heard?
Where you been, boy?
He forgot Cal.
Maybe the Bacigalupis would give him a job.
They were coining money.
Three wagons and a new truck.
It was empty.
Up all night?
I just went for a walk.
I don’t blame you.
I would be too.
Seems silly, doesn’t it?
Want some coffee?
I don’t mind.
How do you think Aron looks?
All right, I guess.
Did you get to talk to him?
No, said Cal.
It was easier that way.
Lee would want to know what he said.
It wasn’t Aron’s day.
It was Cal’s day.
He meant to have it.
Aron came in, his eyes still misty with sleep.
What time do you plan to have dinner, Lee?
Oh, I don’t know—three-thirty or four.
Could you make it about five?
I guess so, if Adam says it’s all right.
Well, Abra can’t get here before then.
I guess that will be all right, said Lee.
Cal got up quickly and went to his room.
Without effort, Aron was taking his day away from him.
It would turn out to be Aron’s day.
Then, suddenly, he was bitterly ashamed.
That’s what I am.
I don’t want to be jealous.
And having gone this far, he proceeded with his self-punishment.
Why am I giving the money to my father?
Is it for his good?
It’s for my good.
Will Hamilton said it—I’m trying to buy him.
There’s not one decent thing about it.
There’s not one decent thing about me.
I sit here wallowing in jealousy of my brother.
Why not call things by their names?
He whispered hoarsely to himself.
Why not be honest?
I know why my father loves Aron.
It’s because he looks like her.
My father never got over her.
He may not know it, but it’s true.
I wonder if he does know it.
That makes me jealous of her too.
Why don’t I take my money and go away?
They wouldn’t miss me.
And I wonder whether Lee likes me.
He doubled his fists against his forehead.
Does Aron have to fight himself like this?
I don’t think so, but how do I know?
I could ask him.
He wouldn’t say.
That would be the truth.
Cal sat in shock from this thought.
His mind tightened up.
Give the money, but give it lightly.
Don’t depend on anything.
Don’t foresee anything.
Just give it and forget it.
And forget it now.
Give the day to Aron.
He jumped up and hurried out to the kitchen.
The oven cricked and snapped with growing heat.
Just around town.
I want to ask you something.
Cal said, I’ve got a little money, Aron.
I’ll give you the money.
What kind of wine?
Let’s make a real celebration.
Let’s get champagne—it can be your present.
Joe Garrisiere said, You boys aren’t old enough.
Sure we are.
Can’t sell it to you.
Cal said, I know what you can do.
That I can do, Joe Garrisiere said.
Four-fifty a bottle.
Isn’t that high?
Sure it’s high!
Send three bottles over, Joe.
To Aron he said, It’s your present.
To Cal the day was endless.
He wanted to leave the house and couldn’t.
Aron seemed perfectly calm.
He tried to write a card to put on it.
To my father from Caleb—To Adam Trask from Caleb Trask.
He thought, Why give it to him today?
That would be easier.
No, he said aloud.
I want the others to see.
It had to be that way.
Why, he had even said it.
I trust you.
He felt much better then.
Cal joined his father and Aron.
Adam was saying, The times are changed.
Aron said, I’ve been thinking about that, and I wonder.
Well, don’t think any more.
Your first choice is right.
Look at me.
Cal sat down quietly.
Adam did not notice him.
His face was concentrated on his thought.
And maybe I can see better than you can.
Lee looked in.
The kitchen scales must be way off, he said.
I’ll bet that bird doesn’t weigh eighteen pounds.
He said there couldn’t be any more universal philosophers.
Yes, Lee said from the doorway, and he deplored it.
He hated it.
Did he now?
Lee came into the room.
Now you question it, I don’t know, he said.
Don’t get so excited, said Adam.
We’re only talking about making a living.
A living—or money, Lee said excitedly.
Money’s easy to make if it’s money you want.
But with a few exceptions people don’t want money.
But do you have any objection to college?
That’s what we’re talking about.
I’m sorry, said Lee.
You’re right, I do seem to get too excited.
Is it that?
Is it that, Aron?
I don’t know, said Aron.
A hissing sound came from the kitchen.
Adam gazed after him affectionately.
What a good man!
What a good friend!
Aron said, I hope he lives to be a hundred.
His father chuckled.
How do you know he’s not a hundred now?
Cal asked, How is the ice plant doing, Father?
Why, all right.
Pays for itself and makes a little profit.
Not today, said Adam quickly.
Monday, if you remember, but not today.
I feel—well, you might call it fulfilled.
And maybe it’s because we’re all together and at peace.
He smiled at Aron.
I was homesick, Aron confessed.
The first few days I thought I’d die of it.
Abra came in with a little rush.
Her cheeks were pink and she was happy.
Did you notice there’s snow on Mount Toro?
Yes, I saw it, Adam said.
They say that means a good year to come.
And we could use it.
I just nibbled, said Abra.
I wanted to be hungry for here.
Lee apologized for the dinner like an old fool.
A courtliness settled over the table.
They proposed toasts.
It’s a present.
Adam was pleased.
Not even Christmas and we have presents.
I wonder what it can be!
A handkerchief, said Abra.
He stared down at the money.
Abra said, What is it?
and stood up to look.
Aron leaned forward.
His voice seemed to come from far away.
What is it?
What— He stopped.
Adam raised his head slowly.
You made it?
Hamilton—we made it—on beans.
It’s for you.
He looked helplessly at Lee.
Almost as remotely his own voice said, Give it back?
Give it back to who?
To the people you got it from.
The British Purchasing Agency?
They can’t take it back.
Then give it to the farmers you robbed.
We didn’t rob them.
Cal felt suspended in space, and time seemed very slow.
His father took a long time to answer.
There seemed to be long spaces between his words.
I send boys out, he said.
I sign my name and they go out.
Not one will come back untorn.
I did it for you,.
I don’t want the money, Cal.
I don’t want the money.
Cal looked straight ahead.
He kept his eyes on his father’s lips.
I like the idea of a present, Adam went on.
I’ll put it away.
I’ll keep it for you, Cal broke in.
I won’t want it ever.
Money, even clean money, doesn’t stack up with that.
Don’t be angry.
That would be something I could value.
Cal felt that he was choking.
He stood up suddenly and his chair fell over.
He ran from the room, holding his breath.
Adam called after him, Don’t be angry, son.
They let him alone.
He sat in his room, his elbows on his desk.
He thought he would cry but he did not.
He could feel himself losing control.
He did not look up.
Lee closed the door gently.
I brought you some coffee, he said.
I don’t want it—yes, I do.
Why, thank you, Lee.
It’s kind of you to think of it.
Lee said, Stop it!
Stop it, I tell you!
What do you want me to stop?
I told you you could control it—if you wanted.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Lee said, Can’t you hear me?
Can’t I get through to you?
Cal, don’t you know what I’m saying?
I hear you, Lee.
What are you saying?
He couldn’t help it, Cal.
That’s his nature.
It was the only way he knew.
He didn’t have any choice.
But you have.
Don’t you hear me?
You have a choice.
Cal said quietly, Aren’t you making a fuss about nothing?
You must be slipping.
You’d think from your tone that I’d killed somebody.
Come off it, Lee.
Come off it.
It was silent in the room.
His father looked up apologetically at him.
Cal said, I’m sorry, Father.
I didn’t know how you felt about it.
I’ll see what I can do about this.
He said casually, Where are the others?
Oh, Abra had to go.
Aron walked with her.
Lee went out.
I guess I’ll go for a walk, said Cal.
The November night was well fallen.
Champagne makes you thirsty, he said.
His father didn’t look up.
Cal’s mind was numb.
I came looking for you.
Aron said, I’m sorry about this afternoon.
You couldn’t help it—forget it.
He turned and the two walked side by side.
I want you to come with me, Cal said.
I want to show you something.
What is it?
Oh, it’s a surprise.
But it’s very interesting.
You’ll be interested.
Well, will it take long?
No, not very long.
Not very long at all.
They walked past Central Avenue toward Castroville Street.
Axel was not an unusual case.
A hitch in the U.
One month between hitches convinced him of that.
He didn’t mind the gentle riding Sergent Dane handed out.
That’s my sweet, the sergeant said.
Arise, we have a customer.
Kemp squinted his crusted eyes.
The war will wait, he said.
Dane looked more closely at the boy.
I hope they take good care of him.
Kemp was relieved that the sergeant wasn’t quite sober.
You think some dame hurt him?
He played any game his sergeant wished.
You think it’s the Foreign Legion?
Maybe he’s running away from himself.
Kemp said, I saw that picture.
I don’t believe it, said Dane.
Step up, young man.
Eighteen, aren’t you?
Dane turned to his man.
What do you think?
I say if they’re big enough, they’re old enough.
The sergeant said, Let’s say you’re eighteen.
And we’ll stick to it, shall we?
You just take this form and fill it out.
It made him uneasy.
Then he could jump in any direction.
Was she stirred up or wasn’t she?
He advised, himself cautiously, Don’t do nothing!
Just stick around and keep your eyes and ears open.
Kate was not thinking.
Kate had laughed too—the quickest and best self-protection.
What would her son do?
What had he done after he went quietly away?
Why had he brought his brother?
What did he want?
What was he after?
If she knew she could take care of herself.
But she didn’t know.
Her right hip ached angrily when she moved.
As far as he could see she hadn’t moved.
He said, I brought you some tea, ma’am.
You don’t feel good, ma’am?
The pain’s back.
The medicine fooled me.
Anything I can do?
She raised her hands.
Cut these off—at the wrists.
Makes you feel hopeless, she said plaintively.
she asked softly.
That dame, ma’am.
You mean Ethel!
I’m getting tired of Ethel.
What is it now?
Well, I’ll tell you like it happened.
I can’t make nothing out of it.
he says, an’ I tell him, Who says?
You was lookin’ for somebody,’ he says.
Tell me about it,’ I says.
Never seen the guy before.
An’ I told him, Well, why don’t she?
I guess he means about her coming back.
Kate said, And then he asked you for some money?
He says something don’t make no sense.
He says, Does Faye mean anything to you?
Not a thing,’ I tol’ him.
He says, Maybe you better talk to her.
Maybe,’ I says, an’ I come away.
Don’t make no sense to me.
I figured I’d ask you.
Kate asked, Does the name Faye mean anything to you?
Not a thing.
Her voice became very soft.
What a goddam fool!
Couldn’t keep his mouth shut.
His mind floundered.
The sudden alarm was good for Kate.
It took the blond head and the pain from her.
It gave her something to do.
She responded to the challenge with something like pleasure.
She laughed softly.
Faith, she said under her breath.
Pour me some tea, Joe.
Joe was quaking with apprehension.
His eyes were moist.
She caught him licking his lips.
Her eyes would not let him go.
Did I catch you out, Joe?
I don’t know what you’re getting at, ma’am.
You’re good at figuring things out.
And send Therese in, will you?
He’d made a mess of things.
He wondered if he’d bollixed up the breaks.
You’re a nice boy.
He wanted to slam the door, but he didn’t dare.
Holding the pen was difficult.
She wrote, moving her whole arm.
You remember Joe.
He works for me.
You want me?
Did I do something?
I tried my best.
Ma’am, I ain’t been well.
The big one is for you girls.
Therese was greatly relieved.
You’re a good girl, Kate went on.
I’ve had my eye on you.
I’m not well, Therese.
You will—are—are you going to the hospital?
I don’t know yet, dear.
But I’ll need your help.
Now here’s some money for the candy.
Shall I go now?
Yes, and kind of creep out, will you?
Don’t let the other girls know what I told you.
I’ll go out the back way.
She hurried toward the door.
Kate said, I nearly forgot.
Will you drop this in a mailbox?
Sure I will, ma’am.
Sure I will.
That’s all, dear.
Here it was.
Maybe she had always known.
She would come back to that.
His face—hurt, bewildered, despairing—had brought it.
Then she remembered.
Then one day she was reading a book.
She could read when she was five years old.
It was Alice in Wonderland.
And she could see the drawings—Alice with long straight hair.
Alice had taught her that.
Let her enemies look for her then!
They couldn’t find her then.
She could walk upright under a door.
It was her threat and her safety.
This was her darling safety.
But she had never gone clear out—never had to.
That was her reserve—guarded from everyone.
Kate shook her head sadly, remembering the cut-off little girl.
She wondered why she had forgotten that wonderful trick.
It had saved her from so many disasters.
She was cold and desolate, alone and desolate.
Whatever she had done, she had been driven to do.
She was different—she had something more than other people.
That was true.
She was smarter and stronger than other people.
She had something they lacked.
The weight pressed down on her, forcing her breath out.
The slugs had only just got up.
The cook came in from the kitchen.
He went out, ma’am.
Listen, she said.
I’ve had no sleep for a long time.
I’m going to take some medicine and sleep.
I’ll sleep the clock around.
Do you understand?
Yes, ma’am, they said.
Good night, then.
It’s afternoon but I mean good night.
Good night, ma’am, they chorused obediently.
Kate turned and walked crabwise back to her room.
She went back to her desk.
I leave everything I have to my son Aron Trask.
She dated the sheet and signed it Catherine Trask.
Last she filed her nails and cleaned them.
She arranged the pillows, patted them up, and sat down.
She leaned her head experimentally against the down pillow.
She smiled at it.
She picked up the tea cup.
Drink me, she said and swallowed the bitter cold tea.
He didn’t have to speak.
The glint of his eyes said, You missed something.
They had something and you missed it.
She thrust her mind back to Alice.
In the gray wall opposite there was a nail hole.
Alice would be in there.
The pain was going from her hands.
Her eyelids felt heavy—very heavy.
She thought or said or thought, Alice doesn’t know.
I’m going right on past.
Her eyes closed and a dizzy nausea shook her.
She opened her eyes and stared about in terror.
Her fast thinking left him confused and helpless.
They were full of horseplay.
Every time she tried, she coughed and lost it.
And the pony stallion had diarrhea.
And then they stole everything that wasn’t nailed down.
Oh, Christ, what a night!
Maybe she’d found out that Ethel was dead.
He’d have to watch his step.
Maybe he hadn’t heard right.
He was sick of working with dames.
Better if he got out of the state anyway.
Three or four minutes at the most.
Don’t tell nobody nothing.
The idea appealed to him.
He was going to get out any way it went.
Her bed had not been slept in.
Finally he opened the door.
The cone of light fell on the reading stand.
Kate’s head was deeply cushioned in the pillow.
You must have slept all night here, Joe said.
She didn’t have a goddam thing—not even a silver-backed hairbrush.
So that’s where you got it, you bitch, he said.
He wanted to punch her in the nose.
Then he thought of her desk.
The two-line holograph will attracted him.
Somebody might pay for that.
He put it in his pocket.
He put that in his pocket too.
Joe laughed aloud.
This was the real breaks.
He tried another envelope and another.
A gold mine—guy could live for years on these.
Look at that fat-ass councilman!
He put the band back.
He pocketed the money too.
He walked to it and opened it a crack.
The cook said, Fella out here wants to see ya.
Who is he?
How the hell do I know?
He might have overlooked something.
The room was in semidarkness.
No one had raised the shades yet.
The sheriff wants to have a talk with you.
Joe felt ice creeping into his stomach.
Got a warrant?
Hell, no, said Oscar.
We got nothing on you.
Just checking up.
Will you come along?
Sure, said Joe.
They went out together.
I should of got a coat.
Want to go back for one?
I guess not, said Joe.
They walked toward Castroville Street.
Oscar asked, Ever been mugged or printed?
Joe was quiet for a time.
Yes, he said at last.
Drunk, said Joe.
Hit a cop.
He tried a snap shot and missed.
Joe began to zigzag.
He fired just as Joe touched the front sight.
Joe splashed forward on his face and skidded a foot.
In 1903 Horace Quinn beat Mr.
Keef for the office of sheriff.
He had been well trained as the chief deputy sheriff.
Sheriff Quinn held the office until 1919.
We could not imagine anyone else being sheriff.
Quinn grew old in his office.
He limped from an early injury.
His old belt holster tugged at his stomach too much.
They were only a couple of whores, after all.
She ran a house which did not get into trouble.
Sheriff Quinn and Kate got along together.
The manila envelopes were glued together with blackened blood.
He sighed deeply.
Every envelope contained a man’s honor and peace of mind.
Effectively used, these pictures could cause half a dozen suicides.
Well, put your lunch off, will you?
Yes, I think you’ll see it’s important.
I’ll wait for you.
As a lawyer, would you say this is any good?
Is this who I think it is?
You knew her, didn’t you?
Well, not to say know.
I knew who she was.
Quinn put his elbows on his desk and leaned forward.
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
His visitor drew up a chair.
His fingers picked at a coat button.
The sheriff asked, Was Kate blackmailing you?
Why should she?
I’m asking you as a friend.
You know she’s dead.
You can tell me.
I don’t know what you’re getting at—nobody’s blackmailing me.
Jesus Christ, he said softly.
You didn’t know she had it?
Oh, I knew it all right.
She let me know.
Quinn took the picture from his hand.
Horace, what are you going to do with it?
Here’s a deck of hell, he said.
These could tear the county to pieces.
Quinn brushed his hands together as though they were dirty.
The negatives were in there, he said.
I’ve been through her desk.
There weren’t any other prints.
Thank you, Horace.
I want you to do something for me.
Here’s a list.
Tell everyone on this list I’ve burned the pictures.
You know them all, God knows.
And they could take it from you.
Get each man alone and tell him exactly what happened.
Tell them that, he said.
Horace, I don’t know how to thank you.
And the sheriff said in sorrow, That’s all right.
It’s what I’d want my friends to do for me.
And he knew he wouldn’t be sheriff much longer.
He sighed and sat down.
Go to your lunch now, he said.
I’ve got work to do.
He’s not home, he said.
Well, he’s on his way.
I called the draft board.
I’ll wait for him.
You like a nice cup of hot coffee?
I don’t mind if I do.
Fresh made, said Lee and went into the kitchen.
Quinn looked around the comfortable sitting room.
He felt that he didn’t want his office much longer.
The sheriff had thought often of that remark.
Sleeping on the ground would make his leg ache.
And, frankly, he didn’t care for venison anyway.
Lee had bought a percolator.
He thought of his own sitting room.
There was a woman’s room too.
But this was a fake.
That would be Lee.
He could still see Adam’s haunted and horrified eyes.
And in the years he had seen much of Adam.
They both belonged to the Masonic Order.
They went through the chairs together.
You couldn’t get into him—he couldn’t get out to you.
But in that old agony there had been no wall.
In his wife Adam had touched the living world.
Adam could do no dishonesty.
He didn’t want anything.
You had to crave something to be dishonest.
The house was still except for the bouncing coffee.
Adam was long coming from the draft board.
Then he heard Adam at the front door.
Lee heard him too and darted into the hall.
The sheriff’s here, said Lee, to warn him perhaps.
Adam came in smiling and held out his hand.
Hello, Horace—have you got a warrant?
It was a damn good try at a joke.
Howdy, Quinn said.
Lee went to the kitchen and rattled dishes.
Adam said, Anything wrong, Horace?
Everything’s always wrong in my business.
I’ll wait till the coffee comes.
Don’t mind Lee.
He listens anyway.
He can hear through a closed door.
I don’t keep anything from him because I can’t.
Lee came in with a tray.
No, I don’t think so.
Adam, was that woman still married to you?
Adam became rigid.
Yes, he said.
What’s the matter?
She killed herself last night.
Oh, my poor darling!
Excuse me, Horace, he said.
What shall I do?
I’ll claim her.
I’ll bury her.
I wouldn’t, said Horace.
That is, unless you feel you have to.
That’s not what I came about.
Adam shrank from it.
Is—is that her blood?
No, it’s not.
It’s not her blood at all.
He doesn’t know—she is his mother.
You never told him?
said the sheriff.
Let’s just tear it up and forget it.
 ’Fraid you can’t, Quinn said.
We do quite a few illegal things.
She had a safe-deposit box.
I went to the bank.
Didn’t wait for a court order.
Thought it might have a bearing.
Well, Old Bob let me open the box.
We can always deny it.
There’s over a hundred thousand dollars in gold certificates.
One other thing—a marriage certificate.
Adam leaned back in his chair.
He saw his coffee and took a sip of it.
What do you think I ought to do?
he asked steadily and quietly.
You don’t have to take my advice.
I’d have the boy in right now.
I’d tell him everything—every single thing.
I’d even tell him why you didn’t tell him before.
He’s a man.
He’s got to take it some time.
Better if he gets the whole thing at once.
Cal knows, said Adam.
I wonder why she made the will to Aron?
Well, what do you think?
Will you stay with me?
Sure I will.
Lee, Adam called, tell Aron I want him.
He has come home, hasn’t he?
Lee came to the doorway.
His heavy lids closed for a moment and then opened.
Maybe he went back to school.
He would have told me.
In his room, said Lee.
Well, call him.
Get him in.
Cal will know.
Adam asked, Do you know where your brother is?
No, I don’t, said Cal.
Weren’t you with him at all?
He hasn’t been home for two nights.
Where is he?
How do I know?
Am I supposed to look after him?
He said thickly, Maybe he did go back to college.
Don’t you think he went back to college?
Sheriff Quinn stood up.
Anything I got to do I can do later.
You get a rest, Adam.
You’ve had a shock.
Adam looked up at him.
Thank you, George.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, said Adam.
When the sheriff had gone, Cal went to his room.
Lee wiped his steel-rimmed spectacles on a dish towel.
He opened the book and leafed through.
And he smiled to himself, consciously searching for reassurance.
He read slowly, moving his lips over the words.
Lee glanced down the page.
That is true, he said.
It’s very hard.
Suddenly Lee felt good.
And he still felt good about it.
Who else would have stolen Marcus Aurelius?
Cal had never drunk before, had never needed to.
Cal could still hear the hoarse cries over running footsteps.
The figure moved quietly away.
He was surprised at how casual his feeling was.
On Friday Cal brooded the whole day long.
Cal was too young to purchase.
Joe Laguna found him and smelled him too.
He looked for the cork and couldn’t find it.
Cal’s head shattered with pain and he was wide awake.
After a while he did the best he could.
He could not live without that.
A panic for Aron arose in him.
He might be injured, might be in trouble.
It was Aron who couldn’t take care of himself.
A sacrifice might reach Aron and bring him back.
He breathed deeply and found the cool air good tasting.
He stripped off another bill and lighted it.
When six were burned Lee came in without knocking.
Cal braced himself for intervention but none came.
Lee folded his hands across his middle and stood silently—waiting.
No, said Lee, I don’t.
I’ll sit down here.
He squatted in a chair, folded his hands, and waited.
He smiled to himself, the expression that is called inscrutable.
Cal turned from him.
I can outsit you, he said.
In a contest maybe, said Lee.
But in day to day, year to year—who knows?
to century sitting—no, Cal.
I don’t have a lecture.
What the hell are you doing here then?
I suspect the first and I can smell the second.
You still smell, said Lee.
First time, said Cal.
I don’t like it.
I don’t either, said Lee.
I’ve got a bad stomach for liquor.
Besides it makes me playful, intellectual but playful.
How do you mean, Lee?
I can only give you an example.
In my younger days I played tennis.
You’d never do that.
You’re too mean, said Lee.
By the way, where is Aron?
He ran away.
I don’t know where he went.
He’s not too mean, said Lee nervously.
I know it.
That’s what I thought about.
You don’t think he would, do you, Lee?
It’s like asking a waiter what’s good tonight.
How the hell do I know?
Don’t make it complicated, Lee said.
You know why you did it.
That’s not difficult.
You were just mean.
I guess that’s what I wonder—why I’m mean.
Lee, I don’t want to be mean.
Help me, Lee!
Just a second, Lee said.
I thought I heard your father.
He darted out the door.
He’s going to the post office.
We never get any mail in midafternoon.
Some get a drink on the way, said Cal.
They see their friends.
And Lee said, Cal—I don’t like your father’s looks.
He’s got a dazed look.
Oh, I forgot.
You don’t know.
Your mother committed suicide last night.
Cal said, Did she?
and then he snarled, I hope it hurt.
No, I don’t want to say that.
I don’t want to think that.
There it is again.
There it is!
It gave him the appearance of deep thought.
He said, Did burning the money give you much pleasure?
I—I guess so.
Are you enjoying your despair?
You’re pretty full of yourself.
Caleb whose suffering should have its Homer.
Dirty in your habits, and curiously pure in your mind.
Cal turned slowly back to his desk.
He said softly, We’re a violent people, Cal.
Does it seem strange to you that I include myself?
Lee went on, That’s why I include myself.
It’s a breed—selected out by accident.
We’re overfriendly and at the same time frightened of strangers.
We boast and are impressed.
We’re oversentimental and realistic.
We eat too much.
We have no taste, no sense of proportion.
We throw our energy about like waste.
That’s what we are, Cal—all of us.
You aren’t very different.
I don’t need to any more, said Lee.
I’m finished now.
I wish your father would come back.
He worries me.
And Lee went nervously out.
Adam, what’s the matter with you?
I don’t know.
His eyes were strange, very clear but unmoving.
He rubbed his hand harshly.
I never faint.
Pioda helped me up.
Just for a second it was, I guess.
I never faint.
Lee asked, Was there any mail?
Yes—yes—I think there was mail.
Thought I read it, he said.
I must have read it.
Lee, I guess I’ve got to get glasses.
Never needed them in my life.
Can’t read it.
Letters jump around.
Shall I read it?
Funny—well, I’ll go first thing for glasses.
Yes, what does it say?
And Lee read, Dear Father, I’m in the army.
I told them I was eighteen.
I’ll be all right.
Don’t worry about me.
Funny, said Adam.
Seems like I read it.
But I guess I didn’t.
He rubbed his hand.
That winter of 1917-1918 was a dark and frightened time.
The Germans smashed everything in front of them.
In three months the British suffered three hundred thousand casualties.
Many units of the French army were mutinous.
Russia was out of the war.
The war seemed hopeless.
The Allied generals were fighting each other.
Submarines slaughtered the crossing ships.
Our spirits sank in those winter months.
Ludendorff was unconquerable.
Nothing stopped him.
Isn’t it strange that today we have forgotten this?
Adam Trask was more puzzled than sad.
He didn’t have to resign from the draft board.
He was given a leave of absence for ill health.
It’s circulation, he said.
It’s my eyes that bother me.
I never had trouble with my eyes.
Guess I’ll have to get my eyes tested for glasses.
Me with glasses!
Be hard to get used to.
I’d go today but I feel a little dizzy.
He felt more dizzy than he would admit.
Almost daily he came back to Aron.
You know that, Lee.
I know it.
That’s what I can’t understand.
Why did he sneak away?
Why doesn’t he write?
I thought I knew him better than that.
Has he written to Abra?
He’d be sure to write to her.
I’ll ask her.
You do that.
Do that right away.
The training is hard.
That’s what I’ve heard.
Maybe they don’t give him time.
It doesn’t take any time to write a card.
Think you’ve got me there, don’t you?
No, I didn’t, but I had a reason.
I didn’t want to enlist.
My father forced me.
I was resentful.
You see, I had a good reason.
But Aron—he was doing fine in college.
Why, they’ve written, asking about him.
You read the letter.
He didn’t take any clothes.
He didn’t take the gold watch.
I guess you’re right.
But I don’t understand it.
I’ve got to do something about my eyes.
Can’t ask you to read everything to me.
His eyes really troubled him.
I can see a letter, he said.
But the words jumble all around.
He would awaken and say, Lee?
Is that you, Cal?
You know I never had any trouble with my eyes.
I’ll just go tomorrow and get my eyes tested.
Let’s get his eyes tested.
Lee was stewing apricots.
I don’t want him to go, he said.
I don’t think it’s his eyes.
Finding out might trouble him.
Let him be for a while.
He’s had a bad shock.
Let him get better.
I’ll read to him all he wants.
What do you think it is?
I don’t want to say.
I’ve thought maybe Dr.
Have it your own way, said Cal.
Lee said, Cal, have you seen Abra?
Sure, I see her.
She walks away.
Can’t you catch her?
But I won’t.
Maybe if you’d just break the ice.
Catch up with her.
Tell her I want to see her.
I won’t do it.
You feel awful guilty, don’t you?
Cal did not answer.
Don’t you like her?
Cal did not answer.
You’d better open up.
I’m warning you.
You’d better open up.
I’ll do it if you tell me to.
But when he gets well you’ll have to.
You’ll have to for yourself.
You can’t carry this alone.
It will kill you.
Maybe I deserve to be killed.
Lee said coldly.
That can be the cheapest kind of self-indulgence.
You stop that!
How do you go about stopping it?
Lee changed the subject.
I don’t understand why Abra hasn’t been here—not even once.
No reason to come now.
It’s not like her.
Something’s wrong there.
Have you seen her?
I told you I have.
You’re getting crazy too.
Tried to talk to her three times.
She walked away.
She’s a good woman—a real woman.
She’s a girl, said Cal.
It sounds funny you calling her a woman.
No, Lee said softly.
A few are women from the moment they’re born.
She knows things and she accepts things.
You sure do think well of her.
Well enough to think she wouldn’t desert us.
And he said, I miss her.
Ask her to come to see me.
I told you she walked away from me.
Well, chase her then.
Tell her I want to see her.
I miss her.
No, said Lee.
Shall we talk about Aron?
Hello, he said.
I thought I saw you behind me.
I want to talk to you.
She regarded him gravely.
Well, I tried to talk to you in school.
You walked away.
You were mad.
I didn’t want to talk to you mad.
How do you know I was?
You’re not mad now.
No, I’m not.
Do you want to take my books?
A warmth fell on him.
Yes—yes, I do.
Lee wants to see you.
He asked me to tell you.
She was pleased.
Tell him I’ll come.
How’s your father?
Not very well.
His eyes bother him.
You know about Aron?
Open my binder and look next to the first page.
He shifted the books.
A penny postcard was in the binder.
Dear Abra, it said.
I don’t feel clean.
I’m not fit for you.
Don’t be sorry.
I’m in the army.
Don’t go near my father.
Cal snapped the book shut.
The son of a bitch, he said under his breath.
I heard what you said.
Do you know why he went away?
I guess I could figure out—put two and two together.
I don’t want to.
Suddenly Cal said, Abra—do you hate me?
No, Cal, but you hate me a little.
Why is that?
I—I’m afraid of you.
No need to be.
I’ve hurt you more than you know.
And you’re my brother’s girl.
How have you hurt me?
And I’m not your brother’s girl.
Our mother was a whore.
She ran a house here in town.
I found out about it a long time ago.
Abra broke in excitedly, What did he do?
He went mad—just crazy.
He yelled at her.
Outside he knocked me down and ran away.
Now you know about me.
Now you have some reason to walk away from me.
Now I know about him, she said calmly.
Yes, your brother.
He was good.
Why did I say was?
He is good.
He’s not mean or dirty like me.
They had been walking very slowly.
Abra stopped and Cal stopped and she faced him.
You want to?
I have to.
Do you know what I mean?
Yes, said Cal.
You sure you know?
All right then.
It’s hard to say now.
I wish I’d said it then.
I didn’t love Aron any more.
I’ve tried to figure it out.
But when I grew up the story wasn’t enough.
Wait—let me get it all out.
Aron didn’t grow up.
Maybe he never will.
How about you?
I don’t want to know how it comes out.
I only want to be there while it’s going on.
And, Cal—we were kind of strangers.
We kept it going because we were used to it.
But I didn’t believe the story any more.
How about Aron?
Cal stood looking at the ground.
Abra said, Do you believe me?
I’m trying to study it out.
When you’re a child you’re the center of everything.
Everything happens for you.
They’re only ghosts furnished for you to talk to.
It’s worse, but it’s much better too.
I’m glad you told me about Aron.
Because now I know I didn’t make it all up.
So he tore up the world.
Cal said, I’ll have to think.
Give me my books, she said.
Tell Lee I’ll come.
I feel free now.
I want to think too.
I think I love you, Cal.
I’m not good.
Because you’re not good.
Cal walked quickly home.
She’ll come tomorrow, he told Lee.
Why, you’re excited, said Lee.
Once in the house Abra walked on her toes.
Here you are, her mother said.
You didn’t come straight home.
I had to stay after class.
Is Father better?
I guess so.
What does the doctor say?
Same thing he said at first—overwork.
Just needs a rest.
He hasn’t seemed tired, said Abra.
Your Father’s very brave, dear.
I should have known.
The doctor says sometimes a man collapses all at once.
Shall I go in and see him?
Can I help you?
Go change your dress, dear.
You don’t want to get your pretty dress soiled.
It was harsh bright with varnish, papered brightly.
Her privacies were of the mind.
Abra felt pleased, and she did not inspect the reason.
For example, she knew that her father was not ill.
He was hiding from something.
The package made her a little lumpy.
You can scrape the carrots, her mother said.
Is that water hot?
Just coming to a boil.
Drop a bouillon cube in that cup, will you, dear?
The doctor says it’ll build your father up.
Her mother came back, saying, I smell fire.
I lit the trash.
It was full.
I’m sorry, Mother, Abra said.
I didn’t think.
You should try to think of these things.
It seems to me you’re getting very thoughtless lately.
I’m sorry, Mother.
Saved is earned, said her mother.
The telephone rang in the dining room.
Her mother went to answer it.
Abra heard her mother say, No, you can’t see him.
It’s doctor’s orders.
He can’t see anyone—no, not anyone.
She came back to the kitchen.
Judge Knudsen again, she said.
She met Cal in the hall between classes.
Did you tell him I was coming?
He’s started some kind of tarts, said Cal.
You’ve got drill, Abra said.
I’ll get there first.
What kind of tarts?
I don’t know.
But leave me a couple, will you?
Smelled like strawberry.
Just leave me two.
Want to see a present I got for Lee?
She opened a little cardboard box.
It’s a new kind of potato peeler.
Takes off just the skin.
I got it for Lee.
Would you like to carry my books home?
Yes, said Cal.
I feel fine this morning, Adam said.
If you can call it morning.
It’s nearly eleven o’clock.
I have to get up.
Yes, what for!
But I feel good, Lee.
I might walk down to the draft board.
How is it outside?
Raw, said Lee.
He helped Adam get up.
I dreamed about my father.
A great old gentleman from all I hear, said Lee.
I read that portfolio of clippings your brother’s lawyer sent.
Must have been a great old gentleman.
Adam looked calmly at Lee.
Did you know he was a thief?
You must have had a dream, said Lee.
He’s buried at Arlington.
How would you like to go over the material?
He was a thief, said Adam.
I didn’t think so once, but I do now.
He stole from the G.
I don’t believe it, said Lee.
There were tears in Adam’s eyes.
Very often these days tears came suddenly to Adam.
Do you know who’s coming to see us this afternoon?
Adam said, Abra?
and then, Oh, sure, Abra.
She’s a nice girl.
I love her, said Lee simply.
No, thank you.
Not this morning.
There was a quiet rising joy in Lee.
It was the joy of change.
Time’s drawing down for Adam, he thought.
I feel immortal.
Death has receded.
He wondered if this were a normal way to feel.
Part of the dream, maybe.
He thought of Sam Hamilton.
He had knocked on so many doors.
But of course—he had so much, he was so rich.
You couldn’t give him any more.
He wondered if that were true.
They acted that way sometimes.
He thought of Cal burning the money to punish himself.
The wind blew cold that afternoon.
Lee wrapped him up and started him off.
I will, Adam agreed.
I haven’t felt dizzy all day.
Might stop in and have Victor look at my eyes.
You wait till tomorrow.
I’ll go with you.
Where are the tarts?
Let’s hide them from Cal.
She sat down in the kitchen.
Oh, I’m so glad to be back.
He hovered over her.
I learned very early not to wish for things.
Wishing just brought earned disappointment.
Abra said gaily, But you wish for something now.
What is it?
She said softly, I wish you were my father.
He glanced quickly at her and away.
Yes, I do.
Because I love you.
Lee went quickly out of the kitchen.
A dragon climbed toward heaven on the box.
Lee said, That was my mother’s only ornament.
My Oriental calm seems to have deserted me, he said.
Let me make the tea, darling.
I’ll get hold of myself that way.
Abra said, I woke up with joy this morning.
So did I, said Lee.
I know what made me feel happy.
You were coming.
You are changed, said Lee.
You aren’t any part a little girl any more.
Can you tell me?
I burned all of Aron’s letters.
Did he do bad things to you?
I guess not.
Lately I never felt good enough.
Is that it?
I guess so.
Maybe that’s it.
Do you know about the mother of the boys?
My mouth is dry.
Drink some tea, Abra.
Do you like Cal?
Abra bowed her head over her tea.
Lee put his hands on the table and leaned over.
You don’t have to, said Abra.
Lee sat opposite her at the table.
Don’t stay away from this house for long, he said.
My father and mother don’t want me here.
I only saw them once, Lee said cynically.
They seemed to be good people.
Sometimes, Abra, the strangest medicines are effective.
I think it would help, she said.
I wonder how I could get the news to them.
Maybe you’d have a bad connection.
Would you tell her where the money came from?
That I would not, said Lee.
Nearly five, she said.
I’ll have to go.
My father isn’t well.
I thought Cal might get back from drill.
Come back very soon, Lee said.
Cal was on the porch when she came out.
I want to unhook this collar.
It’s cutting my head off.
He worked the hooks out of the.
eyes and sighed with relief.
I’m all chafed, he said and took her books back.
You’re too independent.
I could be, said Cal.
This drilling with old Krag-Jorgensens seems silly to me.
The tarts were wonderful, said Abra.
I left one for you.
I’ll bet Aron makes a good soldier.
Yes, he will—and the best-looking soldier in the army.
When are we going for the azaleas?
Not until spring.
Let’s go early and take a lunch.
It might be raining.
Let’s go anyway, rain or shine.
She took her books and went into her yard.
See you tomorrow, she said.
He did not turn toward home.
Not a soul was skating.
Main Street was deserted.
The wind skidded papers on the sidewalk.
Better hook that tunic collar, soldier, he said softly.
The damn thing’s too tight.
I don’t see you around the town at night lately.
Don’t tell me you reformed.
He said, Sounds like you got a girl.
Cal didn’t answer.
Are you picking off his girl?
Oh, sure—sure, said Cal.
Tom’s interest sharpened.
I nearly forgot, he said.
Oh, sure, said Cal.
You’re just a kid.
What are you going to do with all that money?
Cal grinned at him.
I burned it up.
How do you mean?
Just set a match to it and burned it.
Tom looked into his face.
Good thing to do.
Got to go in here.
Tom Meek didn’t like people to kid him.
He’s getting too smart for himself.
Cal moved slowly along Main Street, looking in store windows.
He wondered where Kate was buried.
Was it good or was he fooling himself?
For some reason he remembered the Mexican name for carnations.
Somebody must have told him when he was a kid.
It was a word like nails—claveles.
Maybe he’d better put marigolds on his mother’s grave.
I’m beginning to think like Aron, he said to himself.
The winter seemed reluctant to let go its bite.
They were a part of May Day.
May Day was cold.
Two weeks later they still weren’t out.
Why don’t you just go anyway?
I can’t, said Cal.
I said azaleas.
How will you know?
They say it will be a week or ten days.
Don’t overtrain your picnic.
Adam’s health was slowly improving.
The numbness was going from his hand.
And he could read a little—a little more each day.
I’m glad I didn’t get glasses to ruin my eyes.
I knew my eyes were all right.
Lee nodded and was glad.
He told Dr.
The medical profession is unconsciously irritated by lay knowledge.
I had a patient, Dr.
Murphy said, and he told a hopeful story.
I’m always afraid of recurrence, said Lee.
That you have to leave with the Almighty, said Dr.
We can’t patch an artery like an inner tube.
I bet on his and he bets on mine.
It’s better than horse racing.
Well, I could, said Lee.
But I don’t.
That would spoil the game—and the chart.
How do you keep him from getting excited?
It’s my own invention, said Lee.
I call it conversational therapy.
Must take all your time.
It does, said Lee.
The village, on high ground, dominated the Avre River valley.
It was defended by trenches, heavy machine guns, and artillery.
The front was a little over a mile wide.
At 6:45 A.
Troops involved were the 28th Infantry Col.
The attack was a complete success.
When’d they come out?
Shall we wait till tomorrow?
Do you want to wait?
No, she said.
Neither do I.
Adam heard loud voices and looked into the kitchen.
What’s the hullabaloo?
We’re going on a picnic, said Cal.
Isn’t it a school day?
Abra said, Sure it is.
But it’s a holiday too.
Adam smiled at her.
You’re pink as a rose, he said.
Abra cried, Why don’t you come along with us?
We’re going to the Alisal to get azaleas.
I promised to go down to the ice plant.
We’re putting in some new tubing.
It’s a beautiful day.
We’ll bring you some azaleas, Abra said.
I like them.
Well, have a good time.
Lee looked sharply at him.
I hadn’t thought you were a fool, he said.
Don’t be ridiculous, said Lee.
The back seat was piled with azalea branches.
They dangled their feet in the water.
They always wilt before you get them home, said Cal.
But they’re such a good excuse, Cal, she said.
She reached over and took his hand.
That, she said.
I was afraid to.
I don’t know.
I guess girls aren’t afraid of near as many things.
I guess not.
Are you ever afraid?
Sure, she said.
That was mean, he said.
Her fingers tightened around his hand.
I know what you’re thinking.
I don’t want you to think about that.
Abra said, You think you’ve got it all, don’t you?
Well, I’m going to tell you something.
My father’s in trouble.
How in trouble?
I haven’t been listening at doors but I’ve heard enough.
He’s not sick.
He’s done something.
He turned his head.
I think he’s taken some money from his company.
How do you know?
I heard them shouting in his bedroom where he’s sick.
And my mother started the phonograph to drown them out.
He said, You aren’t making it up?
I’m not making it up.
Now I’m afraid, she said weakly.
The pictures of sweet peas were in color.
Now these would look nice on the back fence.
They’d screen off the slough.
I wonder if there’s enough sun.
It’s age, he said aloud.
That’s funny—listening for something.
I wonder whether I left the teakettle on the gas.
He listened again.
Thank heaven I’m not superstitious.
I could hear ghosts walk if I’d let myself.
The front doorbell rang.
There it is.
That’s what I was listening for.
Let it ring.
I’m not going to be led around by feelings.
Let it ring.
But it did not ring again.
He laughed at himself.
Well, I want the advertisement.
And suddenly he spat at it.
All right, he said.
He stared between his knees at the floor.
No, he said, that’s not my right.
Life and death are promised.
We have a right to pain.
His stomach contracted.
I haven’t got the courage.
I’m a cowardly yellow belly.
I couldn’t stand it.
He folded the telegram and shoved it in his pocket.
He said aloud, I hate a coward!
God, how I hate a coward!
At four o’clock he heard Adam fumbling at the doorknob.
Lee licked his lips.
He stood up and walked slowly to the hall.
All of the lights were on in the Trask house.
The door stood partly open, and the house was cold.
When Cal came in he asked, What’s going on?
Your brother is dead, he said.
Your father has had a stroke.
Cal started down the hall.
Lee said, Come back.
Edwards and Dr.
Murphy are in there.
Let them alone.
Cal stood in front of him.
How bad, Lee, how bad?
I don’t know.
He spoke as though recalling an ancient thing.
He came home tired.
But I had to read him the telegram.
That was his right.
Is he conscious?
Lee said wearily, Sit down and wait, Cal.
Sit down and wait.
Get used to it.
I’m trying to.
Edwards came out, carrying his bag.
Murphy set his bag on the table and sat down.
Edwards asked me to tell you.
How is he?
I’ll tell you all we know.
You’re the head of the family now, Cal.
Do you know what a stroke is?
He didn’t wait for Cal to answer.
This one is a leakage of blood in the brain.
Certain areas of the brain are affected.
There have been earlier smaller leakages.
Lee knows that.
Yes, said Lee.
Murphy glanced at him and then back at Cal.
The left side is paralyzed.
The right side partly.
In other words, your father is nearly helpless.
Can he talk?
A little—with difficulty.
Don’t tire him.
Cal struggled for words.
Can he get well?
You mean he’s going to die?
We don’t know.
He might die tonight.
Will he know me?
You’ll have to find that out for yourself.
He stood up.
I’m sorry, Cal.
You’ll have to bear up.
They always do.
Edwards will be in tomorrow.
Adam’s head was propped up on pillows.
And the eyes were calm, aware but not interested.
Cal sat down in the straight chair beside the bed.
He said, I’m sorry, Father.
The eyes blinked slowly the way a frog blinks.
Can you hear me, Father?
Can you understand me?
The eyes did not change or move.
I did it, Cal cried.
I’m responsible for Aron’s death and for your sickness.
I took him to Kate’s.
I showed him his mother.
That’s why he went away.
I don’t want to do bad things—but I do them.
The doorbell rang.
She opened breeziness as she opened her suitcase.
Where’s my patient!
There he is!
Why, you look fine!
What am I doing here?
Cool pillows, she said.
Don’t you love cool pillows?
Now, where’s the bathroom?
Have you got a duck and a bedpan?
Can you put a cot in here for me?
Make a list, said Lee.
Why would I need help?
We’ll get along just fine, won’t we, sugar-sweetie?
Lee and Cal retired to the kitchen.
I bet she’s that way.
You can eat or not eat, just as you wish.
Cal grinned at him.
If you’d tried to make me, I’d have been sick.
You can’t have a sandwich.
I want one.
It all works out, said Lee, true to outrageous form.
I don’t want a sandwich, Cal said.
Are there any tarts left?
Plenty—in the breadbox.
They may be a little soaky.
I like them soaky, Cal said.
The nurse looked into the kitchen.
Can I phone Krough’s drugstore for the things I need?
Where’s the phone?
Where do you keep the linen?
Where’s the cot you’re going to bring in?
Are you through with this paper?
Where did you say the phone is?
She took another tart and retired.
Lee asked softly, Did he speak to you?
It’s going to be dreadful.
But the doctor is right.
You can stand anything.
We’re wonderful animals that way.
I am not.
Cal’s voice was flat and dull.
I can’t stand it.
No, I can’t stand it.
I won’t be able to.
Lee gripped his wrist fiercely.
Why, you mouse—you nasty cur.
Why is your sorrow more refined than my sorrow?
It’s not sorrow.
I told him what I did.
I killed my brother.
I’m a murderer.
He knows it.
Did he say it?
Tell the truth—did he say it?
He didn’t have to.
It was in his eyes.
He said it with his eyes.
There’s nowhere I can go to get away—there’s no place.
Lee sighed and released his wrist.
Cal—he spoke patiently—listen to me.
Adam’s brain centers are affected.
Don’t you remember?
That wasn’t his eyes—that was pressure.
You don’t know he accused you.
You don’t know that.
He accused me.
I know it.
He said I’m a murderer.
Then he will forgive you.
The nurse stood in the doorway.
What are you promising, Charley?
You promised me a cup of coffee.
I’ll make it now.
How is he?
Sleeping like a baby.
Have you got anything to read in this house?
What would you like?
Something to take my mind off my feet.
I’ll bring the coffee to you.
I’ve got some dirty stories written by a French queen.
You bring ’em with the coffee, she said.
Why don’t you get some shuteye, sonny?
Me and Charley’ll hold the fort.
Don’t forget the book, Charley.
Lee set the percolator on the gas jet.
He came to the table and said, Cal!
What do you want?
Go to Abra.
Bacon looked out.
I want to see Abra, Cal said.
Her mouth dropped open in amazement.
You want what?
I want to see Abra.
Abra’s gone to her room.
Cal shouted, I tell you I want to see Abra.
You go away or I’ll call the police.
Bacon called, What is it?
Who is it?
Never you mind—go back to bed.
You aren’t well.
I’ll handle this.
She turned back to Cal.
Now you get off the porch.
What you up to?
Bacon shouted from inside.
I see you.
Go on now!
Get off the porch!
She was panting from her run.
Got out the back way, she said.
They’ll find you gone.
I don’t care.
Cal said, Didn’t you hear me?
I heard you.
Abra, my mother was a whore.
You told me.
My father is a thief.
I’ve got her blood, Abra.
Don’t you understand?
I’ve got his, she said.
Abra asked, Where are we going?
I wanted to run away from my father’s eyes.
They’re right in front of me all the time.
When I close my eyes I still see them.
I’ll always see them.
Yes, I did.
And his eyes say I did.
Don’t talk like that.
Where are we going?
A little farther.
There’s a ditch and a pump house—and a willow tree.
Do you remember the willow tree?
I remember it.
That’s what I want to do.
She stopped and her hand pulled him to a stop.
No, she said.
That’s not right.
Don’t you want to go in with me?
Not if you’re running away—no, I don’t.
Cal said, Then I don’t know what to do.
What shall I do?
Tell me what to do.
Will you listen?
I don’t know.
We’re going back, she said.
To your father’s house, said Abra.
The light of the kitchen poured down on them.
Lee had lighted the oven to warm the chilly air.
She made me come, said Cal.
Of course she did.
I knew she would.
Abra said, He would have come by himself.
We’ll never know that, said Lee.
He left the kitchen and in a moment he returned.
He’s still sleeping.
I remember that, said Cal.
You ought to.
Lee poured the dark liquor.
Just sip it and let it run around your tongue.
Abra put her elbows on the kitchen table.
Help him, she said.
You can accept things, Lee.
I’ve never had a chance to try.
I’ve had to do my weeping—alone.
Let the ng-ka-py run back on your tongue.
Do you feel that way?
I think so, said Cal.
I don’t know, Abra said.
Lee shook his head.
That isn’t good enough.
That isn’t good enough thinking.
Maybe— And he was silent.
Cal felt the heat of the liquor in his stomach.
Maybe what, Lee?
He held his cup to the light.
Can you think that whatever made us—would stop trying?
I can’t take it in, Cal said.
Not now I can’t.
The nurse said, Have you got a pitcher?
They get thirsty.
I like to keep a pitcher of water handy.
You see, she explained, they breathe through their mouths.
Is he awake?
There’s a pitcher.
Oh, yes, he’s awake and rested.
And I’ve washed his face and combed his hair.
He’s a good patient.
He tried to smile at me.
Lee stood up.
Come along, Cal.
I want you to come too, Abra.
You’ll have to come.
His face was waxen, and his sharp features were sharpened.
He breathed slowly between pale lips.
The nurse said, There he is.
Doesn’t he look nice?
He’s my darling.
He’s my sugar pie.
I won’t have you tiring my patient.
Go out of the room, said Lee.
I’ll have to report this to the doctor.
Lee whirled toward her.
Go out of the room and close the door.
Go and write your report.
I’m not in the habit of taking orders from Chinks.
Cal said, Go out now, and close the door.
Adam blinked at the sound.
Lee said, Adam!
But some things no one but you can know.
No one knows these things except you.
Can you hear me?
The blue eyes wavered, closed slowly, then opened.
Lee said, Thank you, Adam.
I know how hard it is.
Here is your son—Caleb—your only son.
Look at him, Adam!
The pale eyes looked until they found Cal.
Cal’s mouth moved dryly and made no sound.
Maybe a long time.
Maybe an hour.
But your son will live.
Lee wiped his eyes with his fingers.
Cal said, Lee—you can’t.
I have to, said Lee.
If it kills him I have to.
 Lee’s shoulders straightened.
Don’t crush him with rejection.
Don’t crush him, Adam.
Lee’s breath whistled in his throat.
Adam, give him your blessing.
Don’t leave him alone with his guilt.
Adam, can you hear me?
Give him your blessing!
A wrinkle formed between his brows.
Lee said, Help him, Adam—help him.
Give him his chance.
Let him be free.
That’s all a man has over the beasts.
The whole bed seemed to shake under the concentration.
Lee’s face was haggard.
He looked down at the closed eyes.
Lee whispered, Thank you, Adam—thank you, my friend.
Can you move your lips?
Make your lips form his name.
Adam looked up with sick weariness.
His lips parted and failed and tried again.
Then his lungs filled.
His eyes closed and he slept.
I’m stupid about executions.
New York was bad enough.
It was like the first time I saw a cadaver.
Look what can happen in this country, they’d say.
Only I wasn’t steering anything, not even myself.
There were twelve of us at the hotel.
These girls looked awfully bored to me.
Girls like that make me sick.
I’m so jealous I can’t speak.
I guess one of my troubles was Doreen.
I’d never known a girl like Doreen before.
Doreen singled me out right away.
This kind of detail impressed me.
What are you sweating over that for?
Jay Cee’s ugly as sin, Doreen went on coolly.
Somebody tapped at the door.
Who is it?
I didn’t bother to get up.
It’s me, Betsy.
Are you coming to the party?
I guess so.
I still didn’t go to the door.
wife wears B.
She never asked Doreen.
In private, Doreen called her Pollyanna Cowgirl.
Do you want to come in our cab?
Betsy said through the door.
Doreen shook her head.
That’s all right, Betsy, I said.
I’m going with Doreen.
I could hear Betsy padding off down the hall.
Why do they always round up Yalies?
They’re so stoopit!
Doreen had intuition.
We were stuck in the theater-hour rush.
Doreen looked terrific.
She smelled strong as a whole perfume store.
The city had faded my tan, though.
I looked yellow as a Chinaman.
I felt wise and cynical as all hell.
I knew perfectly well he’d come for Doreen.
He had a big, wide, white toothpaste-ad smile.
That sounds boring, the man said.
I’ve some friends waiting as well.
The laughter should have warned me.
How about it, Doreen?
How about it, Doreen?
the man said, smiling his big smile.
I think he must have been smiling the whole time.
It must have been natural for him, smiling like that.
Well, all right, Doreen said to me.
Waddaya think you’re doin’?
He was the type of fellow I can’t stand.
Well, what’ll we have?
the man asked with a large smile.
I think I’ll have an old-fashioned, Doreen said to me.
Ordering drinks always floored me.
It’s amazing how many college boys don’t drink or smoke.
I seemed to know them all.
I’ll have a vodka, I said.
The man looked at me more closely.
Just plain, I said.
I always have it plain.
What do you do?
I mean what do you do here in New York?
I’m a disc jockey, he said.
You prob’ly must have heard of me.
The name’s Lenny Shepherd.
I know you, Doreen said suddenly.
That’ll come in handy.
I’m famous as hell.
Then Lenny Shepherd gave Frankie a long look.
Say, where do you come from?
Frankie asked, sitting up with a jerk.
What’s your name?
This here’s Doreen.
My name’s Elly Higginbottom, I said.
I come from Chicago.
After that I felt safer.
Well, Elly, what do you say we dance some?
Black or gray, or brown, even.
Blue just makes me laugh.
Doreen giggled and kept spooning up the fruit.
I began to think vodka was my drink at last.
I better go now, Frankie said, standing up.
Nobody paid him any notice.
Hey, Lenny, you owe me something.
Remember, Lenny, you owe me something, don’t you, Lenny?
I think it was ten dollars.
Shut up and scram.
Oh, Elly’ll come, won’t you, Elly?
Lenny said, giving me a wink.
Sure I’ll come, I said.
I wanted to see as much as I could.
I liked looking on at other people in crucial situations.
I wouldn’t have missed Lenny’s place for anything.
I think the floor was pine-paneled, too.
Ran over that in Las Vegas.
one an’ only Sunflower!
And when I marry I’ll be wed in Kansas.
What a card!
Isn’t he a card?
You bet, I said.
Listen, Elly, do me a favor.
Sure, I said.
Stick around, will you?
I wouldn’t have a chance if he tried anything funny.
Did you see that muscle?
Lenny popped out of the back room.
I got twenty grand’s worth of recording equipment in there.
She’s the sunflower of the Sunflower State.
Lenny came over, balancing three glasses.
Nothing like listening to yourself talk.
That’s okay, I said.
You don’t have to do that.
Lenny looked relieved.
Just so’s you don’t mind.
He gave Doreen a big white smile.
Would I, honeybun?
My drink was wet and depressing.
I felt like a hole in the ground.
Then Lenny gave a terrible roar.
I sat up.
Leggo, you bitch!
I didn’t know where in the world I was.
I looked at the street sign.
Walking has never fazed me.
The doors folded shut like a noiseless accordion.
It was only me, of course.
There wasn’t a soul in the hall.
I let myself into my room.
It was full of smoke.
The silence depressed me.
It wasn’t the silence of silence.
It was my own silence.
I let out a small, dry laugh.
I could imagine the sort of simultaneous interpreter Mrs.
I decided to take a hot bath.
I meditate in the bath.
I felt angry with Doreen for waking me up.
Doreen was slumped against the doorjamb.
When I came out, she toppled into my arms.
Lemme lie down, lemme lie down, Doreen was muttering.
Lemme lie down, lemme lie down.
Suddenly Doreen grew even heavier.
I drew back.
I felt half-asleep myself.
I made a decision about Doreen that night.
It was Betsy I resembled at heart.
On second thought, I didn’t lock it.
I couldn’t quite bring myself to do that.
There was nobody in the hall.
There were only eleven of us, because Doreen was missing.
Doreen was spending the day with Lenny Shepherd.
My grandfather and I had a standing joke.
They will think you are original and very witty.
Nobody giggled or whispered rude remarks.
Then I tackled the avocado and crabmeat salad.
Avocados are my favorite fruit.
I felt homesick for that sauce.
The crabmeat tasted bland in comparison.
How was the fur show?
It was wonderful, Betsy smiled.
I never really understood Hilda.
She made hats.
That’s amazing, I said.
I missed Doreen.
I felt very low.
Did you go off with Doreen?
I told Betsy how.
For a minute I was tempted.
The show certainly did seem stupid.
I have never cared for furs.
This made me sad and tired.
Then the phone rang.
I stared at the phone for a minute.
Jay Cee here, Jay Cee rapped out with brutal promptitude.
I sank down into the sheets.
Of course, some of the affairs were optional.
There was quite a pause.
Betsy said sympathetically.
Jay Cee had said some terrible things to me.
Doesn’t your work interest you, Esther?
Oh, it does, it does, I said.
It interests me very much.
I’m very interested in everything.
I’m glad of that, Jay Cee said a bit waspishly.
She went straight from this office on to Time.
I said, in the same sepulchral tone.
That was quick!
What do you have in mind after you graduate?
I don’t really know, I heard myself say.
I don’t really know.
You’ll never get anywhere like that.
Jay Cee paused.
What languages do you have?
I’ve always thought I’d like to go into publishing.
You need to offer something more than the run-of-the-mill person.
You better learn some languages.
I’ll see what I can do, I told Jay Cee.
I thought at the time I might actually do this.
She regarded me as a sort of interesting experiment.
The day I went into physics class it was death.
I took the physics book back to my dormitory.
This book was written by Mr.
I heard Mr.
Who is it?
Physics made me sick the whole time I learned it.
Manzi’s special red chalk.
I would fail outright.
Manzi was in perfect agreement with my plan.
They took it as a real step in intellectual maturity.
All the time she talked to me, I saw Mr.
I felt sorry for Mr.
She looked terrible, but very wise.
Don’t let the wicked city get you down.
I wished I had a mother like Jay Cee.
Then I’d know what to do.
My own mother wasn’t much help.
Even the apostles were tentmakers, she’d say.
They had to live, just the way we do.
I thought what a long way I had come.
I had read one of Mrs.
Rollmop on the secluded country farm?
Griselda demanded of her bleak, moonlit pillow.
That was where I saw my first fingerbowl.
It wasn’t the nice kind of rain that rinses.
The movie was very poor.
It was a football romance and it was in Technicolor.
I hate Technicolor.
At about this point I began to feel peculiar.
I felt in terrible danger of puking.
Betsy was staring at the screen with deadly concentration.
Don’t you fee good?
she whispered, barely moving her lips.
No, I said.
I feel like hell.
So do I, I’ll come back with you.
Betsy looked a fright.
We didn’t dare wait to add up the fare.
Luckily for us it was a quiet time of day.
Usually after a good puke you feel better right away.
I felt I just had to go to the toilet.
Betsy was already there.
I thought I would die, it was so far.
The sickness rolled through me in great waves.
I don’t know how long I kept at it.
It didn’t seem to be summer any more.
It sounded a bit like Emily Ann Offenbach.
Just a minute, I said then.
My words bungled out thick as molasses.
She’s all right now.
How many others are there?
the voice went on.
I listened with interest.
The floor seemed wonderfully solid.
Eleven, I think, a woman’s voice answered.
I figured she must belong to the black shoe.
She wore gilt-rimmed spectacles and a white nurse’s cap.
Who are you?
I asked in a faint voice.
I’m the hotel nurse.
What’s the matter with me?
Poisoned, she said briefly.
Poisoned, the whole lot of you.
I never seen anythin’ like it.
Is everybody else sick too?
I asked with some hope.
The whole of your lot, she affirmed with relish.
Sick as dogs and cryin’ for ma.
You’ll sleep now.
Somebody was standing by my pillow with a white cup.
Drink this, they said.
I shook my head.
The pillow crackled like a wad of straw.
Drink this and you’ll feel better.
A thick white china cup was lowered under my nose.
My eyes moved tentatively to the skirt behind the cup.
Betsy, I said.
Betsy nothing, it’s me.
I thought my mouth must be made of sand.
Well, you almost died,  she said finally.
I guess it was all that caviar.
It was the crabmeat.
Who did tests?
Those dodos on Ladies’ Day.
I echoed hollowly.
It was good to have Doreen back.
They sent presents, she added.
They’re in a big carton out in the hall.
How did they get here so fast?
Special express delivery, what do you think?
What are the presents?
Nobody’s opened the box yet, they’re all out flat.
See what the present is, I begged.
Doreen went out into the hall.
The Thirty Best Short Stories of the Year.
She dropped the book in my lap.
There’s eleven more of them out there in that box.
You can have my soup if you want, she said.
Bring it in, I said.
At seven the next morning the telephone rang.
A man’s voice said, Is that Miss Esther Greenwood?
I thought I detected a slight foreign accent.
It certainly is, I said.
This is Constantin Something-or-Other.
Then I remembered Mrs.
Willard and her simultaneous interpreter.
Of course, of course!
I’d never have given Mrs.
Willard credit for introducing me to a man named Constantin.
I collected men with interesting names.
I already knew a Socrates.
Would you like to see the UN this afternoon?
He seemed nonplussed.
I can see it from my window.
There was a silence.
I detected the vocabulary of Mrs.
Willard and my heart sank.
Willard always invited you for a bite to eat.
Willard’s house when he first came to America--Mrs.
I now saw quite clearly that Mrs.
What time will you come?
I’ll call for you in my car about two.
It’s the Amazon, isn’t it?
Ah, I know where that is.
A duty tour of the UN and a post-UN sandwich!
I tried to jack up my morale.
This thought gave me a certain satisfaction.
Buddy Willard was a hypocrite.
Thank you thank you thank you.
Either that, or that particular cabdriver was an out-and-out-louse.
When I opened it a card fell out.
I felt sorry when I came to the last page.
A piece of dust.
I would say.
A piece of dust.
So are the people you think you’re curing.
They’re dust as dust as dust.
I remember the first night he kissed me.
It was after the Yale Junior Prom.
I was flabbergasted.
Of course, our mothers were good friends.
Is that you, Esther?
I just didn’t have any luck.
I didn’t think I deserved it.
I just came over to say hello, he said.
Hello, I said.
Let’s go out and sit on the porch.
She obviously thought Buddy had made a big mistake.
We sat side by side in two wicker rocking chairs.
The sunlight was clean and windless and almost hot.
I can’t stay more than a few minutes, Buddy said.
Oh, come on, stay for lunch, I said.
Oh, I can’t do that.
I’m up here for the Sophomore Prom with Joan.
I felt like a prize idiot.
How is Joan?
I asked coldly.
She was big as a horse, too.
I began to think Buddy had pretty poor taste.
Oh, Joan, he said.
I asked meanly.
Oh, I like Joan.
Joan’s an right.
I went cold with envy.
I decided to expect nothing from Buddy Willard.
If you expect nothing from somebody you are never disappointed.
 A date?
Buddy looked surprised.
Who is it?
Then I added, They’re from Dartmouth.
There’s a question in it you can answer by mail.
I don’t feel like asking you about it right now.
After Buddy had gone I opened the letter.
I’m going I’m going I’m going.
I found myself hugging the senior on watch.
Oddly enough, things changed in the house after that.
I felt dull and flat and full of shattered visions.
I was aghast.
The chemistry lab?
Buddy reached for my hand.
There’s a beautiful view up there behind the chemistry lab.
Finally Buddy stepped back.
I said, surprised.
Wow, it makes me feel terrific to kiss you.
I modestly didn’t say anything.
I guess you g?
out with a’lot of boys, Buddy said then.
Well, I guess I do.
Well, I have to study a lot.
So do I, I put in hastily.
I have to keep my scholarship after all.
In the afternoon we went to see a baby born.
The medical student gave an unpleasant little snicker.
 At least your mother loves you, he said.
Fine, fine, he said to me.
There’s somebody about to have a baby this minute.
Hello, Will, Buddy said.
Who’s on the job?
I am, and it’s my first.
You oughtn’t see this, Will muttered in my ear.
You’ll never want to have a baby if you do.
They oughtn’t to let women watch.
It’ll be the end of the human race.
I think somebody said, It’s a boy, Mrs.
Tomolillo, but the woman didn’t answer or raise her head.
Well, how was it?
Wonderful, I said.
I could see something like that every day.
Why was it all covered with flour?
It was Buddy’s idea.
No, I said.
Well, don’t you think you would like to see me?
I didn’t know what to say.
Well, all right, I guess so, I said.
Buddy seemed hurt I didn’t say anything.
Now let me see you.
 All right.
Buddy got dressed again.
But Buddy didn’t say anything, he just turned pink.
Well, have you?
What do you mean, an affair?
Buddy asked then in a hollow voice.
You know, have you ever gone to bed with anyone?
But I didn’t, I just kept still.
Well, yes, I have, Buddy said finally.
I almost fell over.
Tell me about it.
Who was it?
Buddy seemed relieved I wasn’t angry.
Served up with parsley?
Buddy had laughed innocently.
No, she had said.
After that something in me just froze up.
What does your mother think about this waitress?
I asked Buddy that weekend.
Buddy was amazingly close to his mother.
Just as I thought, Buddy was embarrassed.
Mother asked me about Gladys, he admitted.
Well, what did you say?
I said Gladys was free, white and twenty-one.
He didn’t even have to pay for a stamp.
It was Buddy all right.
I had never heard Buddy so upset.
I only felt a wonderful relief.
I started adding up all the things I couldn’t do.
I began with cooking.
But then, she was practical and a sociology major.
I didn’t know shorthand either.
This meant I couldn’t get a good job after college.
Everybody would want her.
I wanted to dictate my own thrilling letters.
My list grew longer.
I was a terrible dancer.
I couldn’t carry a tune.
I couldn’t speak German or read Hebrew or write Chinese.
Constantin’s restaurant smelt of herbs and spices and sour cream.
Known in the Biblical sense, Eric said.
Eric’s whore hadn’t even taken off her dress.
It was boring as going to the toilet.
Constantin seemed mature and considerate in every way.
I am very fond of balalaika music, I said.
When I was nineteen, pureness was the great issue.
I think I’ll go in and lie down, I said.
The clean bed bobbed before me like a safe boat.
I stretched full length and shut my eyes.
I woke to the sound of rain.
It was pitch dark.
Then I heard the sound of somebody breathing.
I held my breath, but the breathing kept on.
A green eye glowed on the bed beside me.
It was divided into quarters like a compass.
I reached out slowly and closed my hand on it.
I lifted it up.
Constantin’s watch said three o’clock.
For a few minutes I leaned over, studying him.
I had never fallen asleep beside a man before.
Once when I visited Buddy I found Mrs.
Willard’s old suits.
Willard’s kitchen mat.
private, totalitarian state.
Constantin sat up, yawning.
What time is it?
Three, I said in a flat voice.
I better go home.
I’ll drive you.
Is your hair always like that?
It made me go all sleepy and peaceful.
Ah, I know what it is, Constantin said.
You’ve just washed it.
And he bent to lace up his tennis shoes.
Then I thought, Buddy Willard made me break that leg.
Then I thought, No, I broke it myself.
Willard drove me up to the Adirondacks.
At Christmas I almost wished I was a Catholic.
Willard drove and then I drove.
I was tempted to tell Mr.
Willard to go ahead alone, I would hitchhike home.
But one glance at Mr.
I’d have to see the visit through to the end.
Willard had packed for our lunch.
Willard eyed me kindly.
Nelly and I have always wanted a daughter.
For one crazy minute I thought, Mr.
Willard was going to announce that Mrs.
Willard was pregnant and expecting a baby girl.
I think we understand each other.
I’m not sure what I expected of Buddy’s sanatorium.
I found it hard to imagine Buddy lying quietly.
A mottled brown linoleum sealed off the floor.
I flipped to the middle of the nearest magazine.
A buzzer sounded.
Doors opened and shut in the distance.
Then Buddy came in.
I shook it.
It felt moist and fat.
Willard and I sat together on a leather couch.
But everything concave about Buddy had suddenly turned convex.
Even his laugh sounded plump.
Buddy’s eyes met mine.
It’s the eating, he said.
He jumped up, smiling like a glad host.
Would you like to see my room?
I followed Buddy, and Mr.
Willard breathed, it looks comfortable enough.
What are these?
Buddy didn’t smoke.
That’s an ashtray, Buddy said.
It’s for you.
I put the tray down.
I don’t smoke.
I know, Buddy said.
I thought you might like it, though.
Willard rubbed one papery lip against another.
I guess I’ll be getting on.
You be getting on.
I was surprised.
I had thought Mr.
Shall I come too?
See that Esther gets a comfortable seat on the train.
She’ll stay a day or so, maybe.
Buddy escorted his father to the door.
I felt Mr.
Willard had deserted me.
Willard had never been sick a day in his life.
I sat down on Buddy’s bed.
There simply wasn’t anywhere else to sit.
Buddy rummaged among his papers in a businesslike way.
Then he handed me a thin, gray magazine.
Turn to page eleven.
On page eleven I found a poem tided Florida Dawn.
I thought it was dreadful.
Who wrote it?
Buddy asked with an odd, pigeony smile.
I don’t know.
Then I said, Of course I know, Buddy.
You wrote it.
Buddy edged over to me.
I edged back.
Don’t worry, Buddy laughed.
I’m not positive.
You can’t catch anything.
I want to ask you a question.
I’d thought of asking it by letter.
Well, don’t you want to know what it is?
I said in a small, unpromising voice.
Buddy sat down beside me.
I didn’t move.
I had an awful impulse to laugh.
Buddy saw me hesitate.
I’m still on P.
A year from this spring at the latest.
I think I should tell you something, Buddy.
I know, Buddy said stiffly.
You’ve met someone.
No, it’s not that.
What is it, then?
I’m never going to get married.
You’ll change your mind.
My mind’s made up.
But Buddy just went on looking cheerful.
And you said.
Buddy’s smile dimmed.
Well, you were right.
I am neurotic.
You could live between them, Buddy suggested helpfully.
Well, what’s so neurotic about that?
Buddy didn’t answer.
Nothing, Buddy said in a pale, still voice.
I let out a scornful laugh.
Buddy put his hand on mine.
Let me fly with you.
I had no business to be up there.
I had never skied before in my life.
From our chalet for two.
All morning Buddy had been teaching me now to ski.
His persistence in the face of mulishness was astounding.
Buddy seemed pleased with my progress.
Now let’s try you on the rope tow.
I stopped in my tracks, flushed and panting.
But Buddy, I don’t know how to zigzag yet.
Oh, you need only go halfway.
Then you won’t gain very much momentum.
It never occurred to me to say no.
At the top, though, I had second thoughts.
Buddy singled me out, hesitating there in the red jacket.
His arms chopped the air like khaki windmills.
I measured the distance to Buddy with my eye.
I aimed straight down.
I was descending, but the white sun rose no higher.
I thought, This is what it is to be happy.
My teeth crunched a gravelly mouthful.
Ice water seeped down my throat.
Other faces showed themselves up in back of his.
Behind them, black dots swarmed on a plane of whiteness.
The lodge fence propped itself at my back.
I’m going up, I said.
I’m going to do it again.
No, you’re not.
A queer, satisfied expression came over Buddy’s face.
No, you’re not, he repeated with a final smile.
Your leg’s broken in two places.
You’ll be stuck in a cast for months.
I’m so glad theyre going to die.
They surfaced with a hollow pop.
I’m so glad theyre going to die.
Hilda moved like a mannequin the whole way.
That’s a lovely hat, did you make it?
So I said, Isn’t it awful about the Rosenbergs?
The Rosenbergs were to be electrocuted late that night.
It’s awful such people should be alive.
Come on, give us a smile.
Betsy had spied my feet under the doors.
Oh, sure you know, the photographer said.
She wants, said Jay Cee wittily, to be everything.
I said I wanted to be a poet.
Then they scouted about for something for me to hold.
It should be something that showed what inspired the poems.
The photographer fiddled with his hot white lights.
Give us a smile.
I couldn’t stop.
When I lifted my head, the photographer had vanished.
Jay Cee had vanished as well.
It looked bruised and puffy and all the wrong colors.
I started to paint it with small heart.
These’ll amuse you, she said.
Have a good read.
And in a year.
Honestly, Doreen said, this one’ll be different.
Tell me about him, I said stonily.
He’s from Peru.
They’re squat, I said.
They’re ugly as Aztecs.
No, no, no, sweetie, I’ve already met him.
But I gave it up.
It’s these clothes, I told Doreen.
I just can’t face these clothes when I come back.
Hey, leave that one out.
I’m wearing it.
Doreen knocked on the green door with the gold knob.
Scuffling and a man’s laugh, cut short, sounded from inside.
Doreen disappeared in his arms.
I thought it must be the person Lenny knew.
I couldn’t take my eyes off that stickpin.
I put one foot in front of the other.
My nail tapped a glassy facet.
Her first diamond.
Give it to her, Marco.
Marco bowed and deposited the stickpin in my palm.
of a diamond.
The hand round my arm tightened.
Marco removed his hand.
I looked down at my arm.
A thumbprint purpled into view.
Marco watched me.
Then he pointed to the underside of my arm.
I looked, and saw four, faint matching prints.
You see, I am quite serious.
I had never met a woman-hater before.
I’d never had a daiquiri before.
Marco looked at me.
No, I said.
What do you mean, no?
I can’t dance to that kind of music.
Don’t be stupid.
I want to sit here and finish my drink.
It’s a tango.
Marco maneuvered me out among the dancers.
I love tangoes.
I can’t dance.
You don’t have to dance.
I’ll do the dancing.
Then he said, Pretend you are drowning.
What did I tell you?
Marco’s breath scorched my ear.
You’re a perfectly respectable dancer.
Woman-haters were like gods: invulnerable and chockfull of power.
They descended, and then they disappeared.
You could never catch one.
After the South American music there was an interval.
Marco led me through the French doors into the garden.
There was no moon.
The box hedges shut behind us.
I watched him.
Who are you in love with?
I said then.
The ring widened and blurred, ghost-pale on the dark air.
Then he said, I am in love with my cousin.
I felt no surprise.
Why don’t you marry her?
She’s my first cousin.
She’s going to be a nun.
Is she beautiful?
There’s no one to touch her.
Does she know you love her?
the obstacle seemed unreal to me.
Marco dashed his cigar underfoot.
The ground soared and struck me with a soft shock.
Mud squirmed through my fingers.
Marco waited until I half rose.
The mud oozed and adjusted itself to my shoulder blades.
Marco’s face lowered cloudily over mine.
A few drops of spit struck my lips.
It’s happening, I thought.
The word hissed by my ear.
I began to writhe and bite.
Marco weighed me to the earth.
It was like hitting the steel plate of a battleship.
Marco sat up.
I began to cry.
Marco pulled out a white handkerchief and dabbed his nose.
Blackness, like ink, spread over the pale cloth.
I sucked at my salty knuckles.
I want Doreen.
Marco stared off across the golf links.
I want Doreen.
I want to go home.
Sluts, all sluts.
Marco seemed to be talking to himself.
Yes or no, it is all the same.
I poked Marco’s shoulder.
Go to the parking lot.
Look in the backs of all the cars.
Then he spun around.
I got up and retrieved my stole from the darkness.
I started to walk off.
Marco sprang to his feet and blocked my path.
I have earned my diamond with this blood.
Give it to me.
I don’t know where it is.
Marco took my shoulders in both hands.
Tell me, he said, giving each word equal emphasis.
Tell me, or I’ll break your neck.
Suddenly I didn’t care.
It’s in my imitation jet bead evening bag, I said.
Somewhere in the muck.
A stiff breeze lifted the hair from my head.
It was my last night.
I waved it, like a flag of truce, once, twice.
breeze caught it, and I let go.
I tugged at the bundle again.
The face in the mirror looked like a sick Indian.
What a hotchpotch the world was!
I glanced down at my unfamiliar skirt and blouse.
Pollyanna Cowgirl, I said out loud.
I didn’t really see why people should look at me.
Plenty of people looked queerer than I did.
Root Wan Twenny Ate!
the conductor bawled.
My mother was waiting by the glove-gray Chevrolet.
Why lovey, what’s happened to your face?
The upholstery felt slippery and clean.
The car purred into life.
The air punched out of my stomach.
Then my mouth shaped itself sourly.
I had expected it.
As the houses grew more familiar, I slunk still lower.
I felt it was very important not to be recognized.
I had never spent a summer in the suburbs before.
The soprano screak of carriage wheels punished my ear.
The twin bed next to mine was empty and unmade.
Then the front door opened and shut.
The carriage wheels screaked past again.
A serene, almost religious smile lit up the woman’s face.
I knew the woman well.
It was Dodo Conway.
Dodo interested me in spite of myself.
She got a special discount from the local milkman.
I watched Dodo wheel the youngest Conway up and down.
She seemed to be doing it for my benefit.
Children made me sick.
I couldn’t see the point of getting up.
I had nothing to look forward to.
Then I lifted my head from its bolt hole.
The ringing had stopped.
Almost at once it started up again.
I picked up the receiver.
Hullo, I said, in a low, disguised voice.
Hullo, Esther, what’s the matter, have you got laryngitis?
It was my old friend Jody, calling from Cambridge.
Jody wanted to know when they could expect me.
I’m not coming, I said.
I didn’t make the course.
There was a small pause.
He’s an ass, Jody said then.
He doesn’t know a good thing when he sees it.
My sentiments exactly.
My voice sounded strange and hollow in my ears.
Take some other course.
But the hollow voice said, You better count me out.
I reached for the receiver.
I wandered into the dining room.
I slit open the summer school letter with a knife.
Then I opened Buddy Willard’s letter.
I snatched up a pencil and crossed out Buddy’s message.
I thought the message was worth a good three cents.
That would fix a lot of people.
Ockenden at the back.
A feeling of tenderness filled my heart.
My heroine would be myself, only in disguise.
She would be called Elaine.
I counted the letters on my fingers.
There were six letters in Esther, too.
It seemed a lucky thing.
I leaned back and read what I had written.
Why, honey, don’t you want to get dressed?
It’s almost three in the afternoon.
I’m writing a novel, I said.
Inertia oozed like molasses through Elaine’s limbs.
Then I knew what the trouble was.
I needed experience.
How could I compete with that sort of thing?
I would also be saving a whole lot of money.
At first I felt hopeful.
I heard the whisper of her clothes as she undressed.
She climbed into bed.
Then her breathing grew slow and regular.
I counted one, two, three.
The thick book made an unpleasant dent in my stomach.
riverrun, past Eve and Adam’s.
Maybe it was a pub in Dublin.
I counted the letters.
There were exactly a hundred of them.
I thought this must be important.
Why should there be a hundred letters?
Haltingly, I tried the word aloud.
I squinted at the page.
The letters grew barbs and rams’ horns.
I decided to junk my thesis.
So I’d skipped it.
They were even worse.
This surprised me.
Maybe I could study the eighteenth century in secret.
But I didn’t know shorthand, so what could I do?
I could be a waitress or a typist.
But I couldn’t stand the idea of being either one.
You say you want more sleeping pills ?
They don’t work any more.
Teresa’s large, dark eyes regarded me thoughtfully.
I liked Teresa.
She had a gentle, intuitive touch.
I thought it must be because she was Italian.
There was a little pause.
What seems to be the matter?
Teresa said then.
I can’t sleep.
I can’t read.
I turned my hands palm up.
He’ll be able to help you more than I can.
I peered at the writing, but I couldn’t read it.
Doctor Gordon, Teresa said.
He’s a psychiatrist.
Doctor Gordon’s waiting room was hushed and beige.
At first I wondered why the room felt so safe.
Then I realized it was because there were no windows.
The air-conditioning made me shiver.
I was still wearing Betsy’s white blouse and dirndl skirt.
The sweaty cotton gave off a sour but friendly smell.
I hadn’t washed my hair for three weeks, either.
I hadn’t slept for seven nights.
It made me tired just to think of it.
Doctor Gordon twiddled a silver pencil.
Your mother tells me you are upset.
Doctor Gordon waited.
His eyelashes were so long and thick they looked artificial.
Black plastic reeds fringing two green, glacial pools.
Doctor Gordon’s features were so perfect he was almost pretty.
But Doctor Gordon wasn’t like that at all.
For some reason the photograph made me furious.
What did I think was wrong?
When I had finished, Doctor Gordon lifted his head.
Where did you say you went to college?
Baffled, I told him.
I didn’t see where college fitted in.
But he only said, I remember your college well.
I was up there, during the war.
They had a WAC station, didn’t they?
Or was it WAVES?
I said I didn’t know.
Yes, a WAC station, I remember now.
My, they were a pretty bunch of girls.
Doctor Gordon laughed.
See you next week, then.
Well, what did he say?
I pulled the car door shut.
It didn’t catch.
He said he’ll see me next week.
My mother sighed.
Doctor Gordon cost twenty-five dollars an hour.
Hi there, what’s your name?
The sailor fell into step beside me, and I smiled.
Where do you come from, Elly?
You sure are a long way from home.
In Chicago, people would take me for what I was.
I would be simple Elly Higginbottom, the orphan.
People would love me for my sweet, quiet nature.
If I happened to feel like it.
I asked the sailor suddenly.
Well, I dunno, Elly, he said.
I might just go to college on the G.
Nope, said the sailor.
I peered at him from the comer of my eye.
He didn’t look a day over sixteen.
Do you know how old I am?
I said accusingly.
The sailor grinned at me.
Nope, and I don’t care either.
He looked Nordic and virginal.
Well, I’m thirty, I said, and waited.
Gee, Elly, you don’t look it.
The sailor squeezed my hip.
Then he glanced quickly from left to right.
Could you please tell me the way to the subway?
I said to the sailor in a loud voice.
The subway that goes out to the Deer Island Prison?
Take your hands off me, I said between my teeth.
Say, Elly, what’s up?
Willard was at her cottage in the Adirondacks.
I fixed the woman’s receding back with a vengeful stare.
I thought it was somebody I knew, I said.
Some blasted lady from this orphan home in Chicago.
The sailor put his arm around me again.
You mean you got no mom and dad, Elly?
I let out a tear that seemed ready.
It made a little hot track down my cheek.
Say, Elly, don’t cry.
This lady, was she mean to you?
Well, Esther, how do you feel this week?
Doctor Gordon cradled his pencil like a slim, silver bullet.
He quirked an eyebrow, as if he didn’t believe it.
Doctor Gordon seemed unimpressed.
What, I said, do you think of that?
Do you mind?
I could tell she had been crying.
My mother didn’t look at me.
She started the car.
Does he mean live there?
No, my mother said, and her chin quivered.
I thought she must be lying.
Don’t I always tell you the truth?
my mother said, and burst into tears.
SUICIDE SAVED FROM 7-STORY LEDGE!
Will Kilmartin of the Charles Street police force.
It taste dead, like a bit of old tree bark.
The inky-black newspaper paragraph didn’t tell why Mr.
Pollucci was on the ledge, or what Sgt.
I thought seven stories must be a safe distance.
They were the only things I could read.
Everything I looked at seemed bright and extremely tiny.
My mouth tasted of cleanness and peppermint.
My favorite tree was the Weeping Scholar Tree.
I thought it must come from Japan.
They understood things of the spirit in Japan.
They disemboweled themselves when anything went wrong.
I tried to imagine how they would go about it.
They must have an extremely sharp knife.
No, probably two extremely sharp knives.
My trouble was I hated the sight of blood.
I thought I might stay in the park all night.
My appointment at Walton was for ten o’clock.
It was a stop two blocks from my house.
A nurse met us at the door.
Will you wait in the living room, please.
Doctor Gordon will be with you presently.
I paused in the doorway of the living room.
Then I realized that none of the people were moving.
I climbed after Doctor Gordon’s dark-jacketed back.
At the top of the stairs, the garnet-colored carpet stopped.
Doctor Gordon stepped back, and I flattened against the wall.
I lay down on the bed.
The wall-eyed nurse came back.
She unclasped my watch and dropped it in her pocket.
Then she started tweaking the hairpins from my hair.
Doctor Gordon was unlocking the closet.
The nurse started swabbing my temples with a smelly grease.
A vague, medicinal stench emanated from her flesh.
Don’t worry, the nurse grinned down at me.
Their first time everybody’s scared to death.
I shut my eyes.
There was a brief silence, like an indrawn breath.
Then I realized it had been fastened upside down.
How do you feel?
An old metal floor lamp surfaced in my mind.
How do you feel?
But I didn’t, I felt terrible.
Which college did you say you went to?
I said what college it was.
Doctor Gordon’s face lighted with a slow, almost tropical smile.
A few more shock treatments, Mrs.
She stared at me, and I stared back.
Her eyes narrowed.
She stuck out her tongue.
My mother was following Doctor Gordon to the door.
She pulled her tongue in, and her face went stony.
I walked out into the sun.
My mother smiled.
I knew my baby wasn’t like that.
I looked at her.
Like those awful people.
Those awful dead people at that hospital.
I knew you’d decide to be all right again.
STARLET SUCCUMBS AFTER 68-HOUR COMA.
It matched, mouth for mouth, nose for nose.
The only difference was the eyes.
I stuffed the snapshot back in my pocketbook.
I summoned my little chorus of voices.
Doesn’t your work interest you, Esther?
You’ll be a prude at forty.
Factitious, artificial, sham.
You’ll never get anywhere like that.
I hadn’t slept for twenty-one nights.
That morning I had made a start.
It would take two motions.
One wrist, then the other wrist.
Then I would step into the tub and lie down.
I moved in front of the medicine cabinet.
I felt nothing.
There’s no subway.
I’ve got to get there.
Who you got there, honey, some relative?
It’s my father.
He beamed at me.
It’ll run you straight to the prison gate.
I waved back and kept on going.
Hey, you can’t go any further.
That’s prison property, no trespassers allowed.
So long as you stayed under the tideline.
The fellow thought a minute.
Then he said, Not this beach.
He had a pleasant, fresh face.
You’ve a nice place here, I said.
It’s like a little house.
We even got a coffee pot.
I used to live near here.
I was born and brought up in this town myself.
How do you get into that prison?
You get a pass.
No, how do you get locked in?
You got any murderers in there?
Murderers go to a big state place.
Who else is in there?
Nice if you like it, said the guard.
At high tide the bar completely submerged itself.
I remembered that sandbar well.
It resembled a sort of modest conch.
Mummy, that girl’s still sitting there.
I fingered the box of razors in my pocketbook.
Then I thought how stupid I was.
I had the razors, but no warm bath.
I considered renting a room.
There must be a boardinghouse among all those summer places.
But I had no luggage.
That would create suspicion.
The small boy squatted a few feet away.
The water swallowed it with a resonant plop.
Why don’t you go home?
The boy skipped another, heavier stone.
It sank after the second bounce.
Don’t want to.
Your mother’s looking for you.
She is not.
He sounded worried.
If you go home, I’ll give you some candy.
The boy hitched closer.
I’ll give you some money to buy some candy.
He began to pretend he didn’t know me.
The stones lay lumpish and cold under my bare feet.
I thought longingly of the black shoes on the beach.
My flesh winced, in cowardice, from such a death.
Of course his mother killed him.
How can you be sure she killed him?
It was impossible to tell.
But then she says No no again.
But it’s the Yes that matters, Cal said.
It’s the Yes she’ll come back to in the end.
What was she going to kill him with?
I hadn’t forgotten.
Do you suppose they have morphia powders in America?
Cal considered a minute.
Then he said, I wouldn’t think so.
They sound awfully old-fashioned.
It looked one hell of a mess.
Cal seemed pleased.
I’ve often thought of that.
I’d blow my brains out with a gun.
I was disappointed.
The risks of a gun seemed great.
What kind of gun?
My father’s shotgun.
He keeps it loaded.
He widened his pale gray eyes and looked at me.
Does your father happen to live near Boston?
I asked idly.
I guess I’ll go for a swim.
You swim too, Cal.
Jody gave Cal a playful little push.
Cal hid his face in the towel.
It’s too cold.
I started to walk toward the water.
Let’s swim to that rock out there.
I pointed at it.
Are you crazy?
That’s a mile out.
What are you?
When we were waist high, he pushed me under.
I surfaced, splashing, my eyes seared with salt.
Cal did a slow crawl.
Can’t make it.
He was panting heavily.
You go back.
I am I am I am.
That morning I had tried to hang myself.
Only my case was incurable.
They would grow old.
They would forget me.
They would be poor, too.
Cal had turned around and was swimming in.
So I stopped.
I dashed the water from my eyes.
I knew when I was beaten.
I turned back.
She gave me the trolley of flowers.
Then I picked out all those that were dying.
The basin felt cold as a tomb.
What do you want?
one of the nurses demanded sternly.
I’m taking the flowers around.
Then she disappeared.
Hey, where’s my larkspur?
The sharp-faced blonde bent over the trolley.
Other voices joined the voices of the first two women.
They sounded cross and loud and full of complaint.
She’s loused up my yellow roses.
Which way is the graveyard?
I remembered the Methodist church.
Lately I had considered going into the Catholic Church myself.
My mother had laughed at me.
A girl with your sense!
Priests were terrible gossips.
The nun had been born in Arizona.
I think she ended up in some asylum.
The graveyard disappointed me.
I couldn’t find my father anywhere.
A clammy dampness sank through to my skin.
I had asked the salesgirl, Is it water-repellent?
And she had said, No raincoat is ever water-repellent.
But I hadn’t enough money for an umbrella.
Then I saw my father’s gravestone.
I couldn’t understand why I was crying so hard.
My mother hadn’t cried either.
I knew just how to go about it.
Then I laughed.
I had forgotten the most important thing.
I unpinned the little key from the dark velvet.
There were more than I had hoped.
There were at least fifty.
Then I went downstairs and into the kitchen.
A few old, rotting fireplace logs blocked the hole mouth.
I shoved them back a bit.
The earth seemed friendly under my bare feet, but cold.
The dark felt thick as velvet.
Cobwebs touched my face with the softness of moths.
The bottle slid from my fingers and I lay down.
It was completely dark.
Someone was moaning.
A cool wind rushed by.
Then the wind stopped.
Then the voices stopped.
Air breathed and played over my face.
Then I felt warmth, like a hand on my face.
I must be lying in the sun.
I opened my eyes.
It was completely dark.
Somebody was breathing beside me.
I can’t see, I said.
A cheery voice spoke out of the dark.
There are lots of blind people in the world.
You’ll marry a nice blind man someday.
The man with the chisel had come back.
Why do you bother?
It’s no use.
You mustn’t talk like that.
A man’s head peered round the edge of it.
Can you see me?
Can you see anything else?
Then I remembered.
I can’t see anything.
The gap narrowed and went dark.
Who told you that?
The man snorted.
He finished taping the bandage back over my eye.
You are a very lucky girl.
Your sight is perfectly intact.
Somebody to see you.
The nurse beamed and disappeared.
My mother came smiling round the foot of the bed.
A big tall boy followed her.
They said you wanted to see me.
I didn’t think I said anything.
They said you called for me.
She seemed ready to cry.
Her face puckered up and quivered like a pale jelly.
How are you?
my brother said.
I looked my mother in the eye.
The same, I said.
You have a visitor.
I don’t want a visitor.
Then she came back.
He’d very much like to see you.
Who is it?
Somebody you know.
What’s his name.
I don’t know any George Bakewell.
He says he knows you.
That’s me, I thought.
That’s what I am.
You remember me, don’t you, Esther?
You remember me, don’t you, Esther?
I’m George Bakewell.
I go to your church.
You dated my roommate once at Amherst.
I thought I placed the boy’s face then.
What are you doing here?
I’m houseman at this hospital.
He didn’t really know me, either.
I turned my face to the wall.
Get out, I said.
Get the hell out and don’t come back.
I want to see a mirror.
Why can’t I see a mirror?
Why can’t I?
Because you better not.
Because you don’t look very pretty.
Oh, just let me see.
The nurse sighed and opened the top bureau drawer.
At first I didn’t see what the trouble was.
It wasn’t a mirror at all, but a picture.
The mouth in the mirror cracked into a grin.
A minute after the crash another nurse ran in.
Didn’t I tell you, I could hear her say.
But I only.
Didn’t I tell you!
I listened with mild interest.
Anybody could drop a mirror.
I didn’t see why they should get so stirred up.
The other, older nurse came back into the room.
She stood there, arms folded, staring hard at me.
Seven years’ bad luck.
That’s only a superstition, I said then.
At you-know-where they’ll take care of her!
They don’t have that sort of ward at our hospital.
I liked it where I was.
My mother’s mouth tightened.
You should have behaved better, then.
You shouldn’t have broken that mirror.
Then maybe they’d have let you stay.
Why can’t I get up?
I’m not sick.
Ward rounds, the nurse said.
You can get up after ward rounds.
The woman looked at me and giggled.
Why are you here?
She didn’t wait for an answer.
I’m here on account of my French-Canadian mother-in-law.
She giggled again.
Then she said, What’s the matter with you?
I tried to kill myself.
The woman stared at me.
They were all smiling with bright, artificial smiles.
They grouped themselves at the foot of my bed.
And how are you feeling this morning, Miss Greenwood?
I tried to decide which one of them had spoken.
I hate saying anything to a group of people.
I feel lousy.
Somebody else scribbled something on a clipboard.
I can’t sleep.
They interrupted me.
But the nurse says you slept last night.
I looked around the crescent of fresh, strange faces.
I can’t read.
I raised my voice.
I can’t eat.
Finally, the gray-haired man stepped out.
Thank you, Miss Greenwood.
And how are you feeling today, Mrs.
Oh, I’m fine, doctor.
I’m just fine.
Then somebody said,  All right, Mrs.
Every time my mother moved, Mrs.
Tomolillo imitated her.
Don’t move, I told my mother in a low voice.
That woman’s imitating you.
Why no, she’s not, my mother said.
She’s not even paying any attention to us.
The lawn was white with doctors.
I’m Doctor Soandso, I’m Doctor Soandso.
My mother drew back sharply.
Oh, Esther, I wish you would cooperate.
They say you don’t cooperate.
Then I’d be all right.
You got me in here, I said.
You get me out.
I promise, I said in a loud, conspicuous voice.
The Negro kept grinning and chuckling in a silly way.
The woman left the room, locking the door behind her.
I could tell we were his first crazy people.
That’s very nice of you, Esther, the nurse said pleasantly.
the nurse said in a sad voice.
I think you better eat in your room today.
Mole and led Mrs.
All the way down the hall to her room, Mrs.
We’re not done, I told him.
You can just wait.
The Negro widened his eyes in mock wonder.
He glanced round.
The nurse had not yet returned from locking up Mrs.
The Negro made me an insolent bow.
Miss Mucky-Muck, he said under his breath.
The third and last tureen was chock-full of baked beans.
Oh Miz, oh Miz, he moaned, rubbing his leg.
You shouldn’t of done that, you shouldn’t, you reely shouldn’t.
Don’t you want to get up today?
You see, it’s normal.
I only burrowed down further in the bed.
I peeped out.
Look what you’ve done!
I’m sorry, I said.
It was an accident.
The second nurse fixed me with a baleful eye.
You did it on purpose.
I saw you.
I smiled and smiled at the small silver ball.
I couldn’t imagine what they had done with Mrs.
One jump, and the water would be over my head.
I wasn’t quite sure why Mrs.
Guinea had turned up.
My mother said that Mrs.
Guinea had telegrammed, Is there a boy in the case?
If there was a boy in the case, Mrs.
Guinea couldn’t, of course, have anything to do with it.
She thinks she will never write again.
My mother told me I should be grateful.
Guinea she didn’t know where I’d be.
I knew where I’d be though.
I knew I should be grateful to Mrs.
Guinea, only I couldn’t feel a thing.
The tires hummed briefly over the grill of the bridge.
I had my own room again.
A window with a screen, but no bars.
If I jumped I wouldn’t even bruise my knees.
The journey over the bridge had unnerved me.
I had missed a perfectly good chance.
The river water passed me by like an untouched drink.
My name is Doctor Nolan.
I am to be Esther’s doctor.
I was surprised to have a woman.
I didn’t think they had woman psychiatrists.
There were white linen tablecloths and glasses and paper napkills.
The girl raised her eyes and smiled.
Who are you?
Where is everybody?
Oh, OT, the gold course, playing badminton.
The nurses began sticking the labels onto the clothes.
I walked back to the lounge.
They mustn’t be really sick at all, to do that.
I sat down near Valerie and observed her carefully.
What the hell is she doing here?
There’s nothing the matter with her.
Do you mind if I smoke?
I said no, I liked the smell of smoke.
I thought if Doctor Nolan smoked, she might stay longer.
Tell me about Doctor Gordon, Doctor Nolan said suddenly.
Did you like him?
I gave Doctor Nolan a wary look.
No, I said.
I didn’t like him at all.
I didn’t like what he did to me.
Did to you?
While I was telling her she went very still.
That was a mistake, she said then.
It’s not supposed to be like that.
I stared at her.
If anyone does that to me again I’ll kill myself.
Why, she finished, some people even like them.
It wasn’t an ordinary-size box, but an extremely tiny box.
I thought I might go in and make friends.
My name’s Esther, what’s your name?
The woman didn’t stir, just stared up at the ceiling.
I felt hurt.
A nurse popped her head in at the door.
Oh, there you are, she said to me.
Visiting Miss Norris.
And she disappeared again.
But Miss Norris didn’t answer.
Lie down, the nurse said.
I’m going to give you another injection.
Then I pulled down the trousers of my silk pajamas.
My word, what all have you got under there?
The nurse made a little clucking noise.
Then she said, Which side?
It was an old joke.
The left side looked darker than the right.
You name it.
Lucky you, Valerie said.
You’re on insulin.
Oh, it will.
I’ve had it.
Tell me when you get a reaction.
But I never seemed to get any reaction.
I just grew fatter and fatter.
Have you seen my scars?
They never let Miss Norris out at all.
Do you know what these scars are?
What are they?
I’ve had a lobotomy.
How do you feel?
I’m not angry any more.
Before, I was always angry.
I was in Wymark, before, and now I’m in Caplan.
What will you do when you get out?
Oh, I’m not leaving, Valerie laughed.
I like it here.
Why should I be moving?
You’ll like it.
There’s lots more sun.
Where are you moving to?
I asked her now.
I’m afraid Miss Norris isn’t moving up like you.
Somebody you know’s just come today.
Somebody I know?
The nurse laughed.
Don’t look at me like that.
It’s not a policeman.
She lives next door.
Why don’t you pay her a visit?
Still, I went out and knocked on the neighboring door.
called a gay voice.
How nice to see you.
They told me you were here.
I said tentatively, then Joan!
in confusion and disbelief.
Joan beamed, revealing her large, gleaming, unmistakable teeth.
It’s really me.
I thought you’d be surprised.
I had never known Joan, except at a cool distance.
How did you get here?
I curled up on Joan’s bed.
I read about you, Joan said.
I read about you, and I ran away.
How do you mean?
I said evenly.
Besides, only old people ever got bunions.
Did your feet hurt much?
Why didn’t you quit?
Oh, I did quit, more or less.
I stayed off work on sick leave.
I didn’t go out.
I didn’t see anyone.
Did he come back?
I was going to kill myself, mind you.
What could I say?
Oh no,’ I said.
Eighteen separate eyes.
I could see me dollar signs in his eyes.
That’s what he said.
I was growing involved in spite of myself.
That’s not even human.
That’s just what I said.
I went straight home and wrote that doctor a letter.
Did you get any answer?
I don’t know.
That was the day I read about you.
How do you mean?
I’ve got a pile of clippings somewhere.
Here, have a look.
SCHOLARSHIP GIRL MISSING.
Bloodhounds used in search for missing girl.
Bill Hindly says: It doesn’t look good.
GIRL FOUND ALIVE!
You keep them, Joan said.
You ought to stick them in a scrapbook.
I folded the clippings and slipped them in my pocket.
I read about you, Joan went on.
Why New York?
What did you do?
Joan grinned sheepishly and stretched out her hands, palm up.
How did you do that?
I shoved my fists through my roommate’s window.
My old college roommate.
But you’re all right now.
I made it a statement.
Joan considered me with her bright, pebble-gray eyes.
I guess so, she said.
 Aren’t you?
I had fallen asleep after the evening meal.
I was awakened by a loud voice.
The sharp, wry figure of Mrs.
Bannister, the night nurse, scurried into view.
Here, we don’t want you to break this.
She unfastened the band of my watch.
What’s the matter?
Bannister’s face twisted into a quick smile.
You’ve had a reaction.
Yes, how do you feel?
Sort of light and airy.
Bannister helped me sit up.
You’ll be better now.
You’ll be better in no time.
Would you like some hot milk?
And when Mrs.
Bannister tells me you had a reaction.
says you felt better.
I did for a while.
Now I’m the same again.
I’ve news for you.
Well, don’t you want to hear what it is?
I said dully, and braced myself.
You’re not to have any more visitors for a while.
I stared at Doctor Nolan in surprise.
Why that’s wonderful.
I thought you’d be pleased.
That afternoon my mother had come to visit me.
I hated these visits.
My mother was the worst.
That afternoon my mother had brought me the roses.
Save them for my funeral, I’d said.
My mother’s face puckered, and she looked ready to cry.
But Esther, don’t you remember what day it is today?
I thought it might be Saint Valentine’s day.
It’s your birthday.
Doctor Nolan nodded.
She seemed to know what I meant.
You’re a lucky girl today.
Why am I lucky?
The nurse looked at me expectantly.
Belsize, I said.
I can’t go there.
I’m not ready.
I’m not well enough.
Of course, you’re well enough.
What was she trying to prove?
I hadn’t changed.
Nothing had changed.
And Belsize was the best house of all.
Joan would be at Belsize.
Perhaps Joan would be gone when I got to Belsize.
At least at Belsize I could forget about shock treatments.
At Caplan a lot of the women had shock treatments.
Piano music sounded from the end of the hall.
The short, spry blonde woman at my table laughed.
I almost had Doctor Loring where I wanted him today.
She widened her starey blue eyes like a little doll.
I decided to put a lid on their nasty talk.
Savage, had gone to Vassar.
That’s very nice, I said in a conversational voice.
DeeDee stopped playing.
Let me see.
Oh no, DeeDee said.
She looked at the magazine again, then at me.
Oh, but it is Esther, isn’t it, Esther?
Loubelle and Mrs.
A faint breath fanned the back of my neck.
I wheeled round.
No kidding, she said, is that really you?
No, it’s not me.
Joan’s quite mistaken.
It’s somebody else.
Oh, say it’s you!
But I pretended I didn’t hear her and turned away.
Nights I’m over here, watching you.
Oh, we’re good.
We’re the best of the lot, and you know it.
Oh, you’re all right.
Do you work in both places then?
I asked with sudden interest.
You wouldn’t like it over there one bit, Lady Jane.
Oh, it’s not a nice place, like this.
This is a regular country club.
Over there they’ve got nothing.
No OT to talk of, no walks….
Why haven’t they got walks?
Not enough em-ploy-ees.
The nurse scooped in a trick and Loubelle groaned.
Will you clear out of here, too?
Joan wanted to know.
Only private cases from then on.
When I feel like it….
But I’d stopped listening.
the nurse demanded rudely.
Yes, I said, moving off down the hall.
I’m frozen stiff.
I woke warm and placid in my white cocoon.
I was beginning to resign myself.
The nurse would be mistaking me for somebody else.
New nurses often did that.
What’s the name?
Greenwood, Greenwood, Greenwood.
Greenwood, no breakfast today.
I caught the rim of her counter with both hands.
There must be a mistake.
Are you sure it’s Greenwood?
Greenwood, the maid said decisively as the nurse came in.
The nurse looked questioningly from me to the maid.
But I didn’t wait to hear what the nurse said.
Savage would not come.
The nurse bent over me and called my name.
I pulled away and crouched farther into the corner.
The nurse disappeared.
You said you’d tell me!
I shouted at her through the dishevelled blanket.
But I am telling you, Doctor Nolan said.
I peered at her through swollen lids.
Why didn’t you tell me last night?
I only thought it would keep you awake.
If I’d known.
You said you’d tell me.
Listen, Esther, Doctor Nolan said.
I’m going over with you.
I looked at her.
She seemed very upset.
I waited a minute.
Then I said, Promise you’ll be there.
I held back, and Doctor Nolan waited.
Do you want to sit down?
I’d rather stand.
Is this Esther?
Yes, Miss Huey.
I’ve told her about you.
I thought the woman must be seven feet tall.
It looked like maps of the craters on the moon.
Anderson won’t mind waiting, will you, Mr.
Talk to me, I said.
I rubbed my eyes with an awkward hand.
All the heat and fear had purged itself.
I felt surprisingly at peace.
I was open to the circulating air.
Well, it will always be like that, she said firmly.
I gulped in a long draught of air.
For how long?
That depends, Doctor Nolan said, on you and me.
Then I put down the knife and looked at it.
Why, she couldn’t even keep a boy like Buddy Willard.
Good for you.
I kept my eyes on my book.
Don’t you want to know who it’s from?
Well, isn’t that a coincidence!
What do you mean, a coincidence?
I got a letter too.
I wonder if they’re the same.
He’s better, Joan said.
He’s out of the hospital.
Are you going to marry him?
No, I said.
Joan grinned evasively.
I didn’t like him much, anyway.
No, it was his family I liked.
You mean Mr.
Joan’s voice slid down my spine like a draft.
I loved them.
They were so nice, so happy, nothing like my parents.
Oh, I couldn’t, Joan said.
Not with you dating Buddy.
I would have looked.
don’t know, funny.
I suppose so.
Are you, Joan hesitated, going to let him come?
I don’t know.
 Are you?
Yes, Joan breathed.
Maybe he’ll bring his mother.
I’m going to ask him to bring his mother.
I like Mrs.
Willard’s a wonderful, wonderful woman.
She’s been a real mother to me.
I had a picture of Mrs.
Joan and Mrs.
One knocked, and knocked again, then went away.
Then somebody gave a low giggle.
A cigarette glowed between the fingers of her right hand.
I just wanted.
I know, said DeeDee.
Now Joan said stoutly, I never really liked Buddy Willard.
He thought he knew everything.
He thought he knew everything about women….
I looked at Joan.
Sometimes I wondered if I had made Joan up.
Doctor Nolan paused.
Then she said, Tenderness.
That shut me up.
I like you, Joan was saying.
I like you better than Buddy.
But what were they doing?
I had asked.
I was disappointed.
But what about your career?
she had cried.
My head ached.
Why did I attract these weird old women?
I like you.
That’s tough, Joan, I said, picking up my book.
Because I don’t like you.
You make me puke, if you want to know.
I waited for the doctor, wondering if I should bolt.
What’s your appointment for?
What do you mean, for?
The receptionist glanced up at me, and I blushed.
A fitting, isn’t it?
she said kindly.
Are you a student?
That will only be half-price then.
Five dollars, instead of ten.
Shall I bill you?
Yes, I said, but.
Doctor Nolan waited until I was finished.
Then she burst out laughing.
I leafed nervously through an issue of Baby Talk.
How easy having babies seemed to the women around me!
Why was I so unmaternal and apart?
I had done well by my shopping privileges, I thought.
I was my own woman.
I’m going to be a psychiatrist.
Joan spoke with her usual breathy enthusiasm.
We were drinking apple cider in the Belsize lounge.
Oh, I said dryly, that’s nice.
I never talked about Egos and Ids with Doctor Nolan.
I didn’t know just what I talked about really.
going to live out, now.
I tuned in on Joan then.
I demanded, trying to hide my envy.
They’re not letting you live on your own, are they?
Joan had only that week been given town privileges again.
Oh no, of course not.
I’m living in Cambridge with Nurse Kennedy.
I raised my apple cider glass, and we clinked.
When are you leaving?
On the first of the month.
Joan grew wistful.
You’ll come visit me, won’t you, Esther?
But I thought, Not likely.
It hurts, I said.
Is it supposed to hurt?
Irwin didn’t say anything.
Then he said, Sometimes it hurts.
I glanced at my watch.
Five past four.
Why, you’ve a watch yourself!
The man looked ruefully at his watch.
He lifted it and shook it by his ear.
He smiled engagingly.
Where are you going?
Would you like some coffee first?
A very small cup of coffee?
Irwin seemed embarrassed.
I think it may be a lady.
Irwin had a queer, old-world habit of calling women ladies.
Fine, fine, I gestured largely.
Bring her in.
Irwin shook his head.
You would upset her.
I smiled into my amber cylinder of cold beer.
The doorbell rang again with a peremptory jab.
Irwin sighed and rose to answer it.
Irwin’s voice drifted back to me through the chilly hall.
I’m sorry, Olga.
Then, finally, Perhaps, Olga.
You do like wine, Irwin observed.
I imagine him.
Irwin reached for my hand.
Irwin laughed and flung me down on the bed.
But all I felt was sharp, startlingly bad pain.
It hurts, I said.
Is it supposed to hurt?
Irwin didn’t say anything.
Then he said, Sometimes it hurts.
A warm liquid was seeping out between my legs.
Tentatively, I reached down and touched it.
Irwin, I said nervously, bring me a towel.
It was half black with blood.
I announced; sitting up with a start.
Oh, that often happens, Irwin reassured me.
You’ll be all right.
It occurred to me that the blood was my answer.
I couldn’t possibly be a virgin any more.
I smiled into the dark.
I felt part of a great tradition.
But the towel came away black and dripping.
I better go home, I said faintly.
Yes, I think I better.
Then I pulled on my sweaty clothes.
I kept hoping every minute that it would stop.
Joan opened the door with an expression of glad surprise.
Why, Esther, Joan said, what on earth’s the matter?
Is that nurse here?
No, she’s on night duty at Caplan.
You look funny, Joan said.
You better get a doctor.
Still she hadn’t noticed anything.
What is it?
Then she propped some pillows under my blood-stained feet.
Then she stood back and demanded, Who was that man?
Oh somebody, I said, with a flabby gesture of dismissal.
Get a towel.
The first number didn’t answer.
What’s the trouble?
He’ll only come for regular customers or emergencies.
Sunday--the doctor’s paradise!
For God’s sake, I said, tell them I’m an emergency.
Joan began to cry.
Look, Joan, I said painstakingly, call up the local hospital.
Tell them it’s an emergency.
They’ll have to take me.
Joan brightened and dialed a fifth number.
Then Joan called a taxi.
Joan insisted on riding with me.
A nurse bustled out from behind a white screen.
I winced at a particularly bad jab.
The doctor whistled.
You’re one in a million.
What do you mean?
The doctor spoke in a low,.
But can you fix it?
The doctor laughed.
Oh, I can fix it, all right.
I was roused by a tap on my door.
It was past midnight, and the asylum quiet as death.
I couldn’t imagine who would still be up.
I switched on the bedside light.
I’ll do what I can, I told Doctor Quinn.
We would like to find out where Joan is.
We thought you might have an idea.
Suddenly I wanted to dissociate myself from Joan completely.
I don’t know, I said coldly.
Isn’t she in her room?
It was well after the Belsize curfew hour.
Who was she with?
She was alone.
Doctor Quinn paused.
Surely she’ll be back.
Something must have held her up.
Doctor Quinn shook her head.
The last trolley went by an hour ago.
Maybe she’ll come back by taxi.
Doctor Quinn sighed.
Have you tried the Kennedy girl?
I went on.
Where Joan used to live?
Doctor Quinn nodded.
Oh, she’d never go there.
we’ve tried them, too.
Another tap woke me in the frost-gray dawn.
This time I opened the door myself.
Facing me was Doctor Quinn.
I thought you should know, Doctor Quinn said.
Joan has been found.
Doctor Quinn’s use of the passive slowed my blood.
In the woods, by the frozen ponds.
I opened my mouth, but no words came out.
Dead, said Doctor Quinn.
I’m afraid she’s hanged herself.
The heart of winter!
Massachusetts would be sunk in a marble calm.
Everybody would know about me, of course.
A daughter in an asylum!
I had done that to her.
Still, she had obviously decided to forgive me.
We’ll act as if all this were a bad dream.
A bad dream.
A bad dream.
I remembered everything.
But they were part of me.
They were my landscape.
A man to see you!
 A man to see you!
the girl on watch had said, on the dormitory phone.
Those girls, too, sat under bell jars of a sort.
Well, Buddy, I said.
We stood there, looking at each other.
I waited for a touch of emotion, the faintest glow.
Nothing but a great, amiable boredom.
How did you get here?
I asked finally.
In all this snow?
Well, Buddy grinned, I’m stuck outside in a drift.
The hill was too much for me.
Is there anyplace I can borrow a shovel?
We can get a shovel from one of the groundsmen.
Buddy turned to go.
Wait, I’ll come and help you.
Oh, Buddy, I laughed.
I’m all right.
Oh, I know, I know, Esther, Buddy said hastily.
It’s you who oughtn’t to dig out cars, Buddy.
And Buddy did let me do most of the work.
I was grateful for the car and the snowdrift.
I’ve been wondering.
What have you been wondering?
I’ve been wondering.
I’ll tell you if I can, Buddy.
and then Joan.
Of course you didn’t do it!
I heard Doctor Nolan say.
Nobody did it.
She did it.
You had nothing to do with us, Buddy.
Well, Buddy breathed.
I’m glad of that.
And he drained his tea like a tonic medicine.
I hear you’re leaving us.
Only if the doctors say yes.
I have my interview tomorrow.
I hope so.
Valerie’s last, cheerful cry had been So long!
Be seeing you.
Not if I know it, I thought.
But I wasn’t sure.
I wasn’t sure at all.
I wonder who you’ll marry now, Esther.
I didn’t know at all.
I have a bill here, Irwin.
Yes, Irwin said.
Yes, Irwin said.
All right, all right, I’m writing a check now.
I’m writing them a blank check.
Irwin’s voice altered subtly.
When am I going to see you?
Do you really want to know?
Never, I said, and hung up with a resolute click.
I felt unaccountably weak-kneed and relieved.
Irwin’s voice had meant nothing to me.
I was perfectly free.
Joan’s parents invited me to the funeral.
I had been, Mrs.
Gilling said, one of Joan’s best friends.
I am, I am, I am.
Don’t be scared, Doctor Nolan had said.
Instead, all I could see were question marks.
I kept shooting impatient glances at the closed boardroom door.
Something old, something new.
But I wasn’t getting married.
All right, Esther.
I rose and followed her to the open door.
